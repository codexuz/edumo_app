      "question": "Should professionals be required to work in their home country after completing their training?",
      "paragraph": "While many people hold the belief that professionals, including doctors and engineers, bear a responsibility to their home country where they received their training, I hold the view that they should have the freedom to work in any country they prefer due to the potential for higher earnings.\nOn one hand, it is argued that professionals often receive significant financial support from their government to complete their training. It is only reasonable that they reciprocate this support by contributing their skills to the same country. This is especially justified because their work often brings substantial benefits to society, which is why the government invested in their education in the first place. For instance, in the UK, substantial funds are allocated to train junior doctors, covering university tuition fees and on-the-job training.\nHowever, every individual should be afforded the opportunity to reach their full potential. Professionals, by virtue of their qualifications, represent some of the most highly skilled individuals globally. Consequently, there is a high demand for their expertise worldwide, allowing them to command significantly higher salaries when working abroad. Restricting their ability to do so would result in a considerable financial disadvantage for the individual. Take, for example, petroleum engineers who can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars more in oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia compared to staying in Europe. In my opinion, the individual's right to choose where they work should take precedence over any nationalist sentiments.\nIn conclusion, despite the substantial investment in a professional's education and training, they should have the autonomy to decide whether to give back to their home country through their work or seek opportunities in regions that offer higher compensation for their skills.\n"

      "question": "Should we prioritize researching our family history or focusing on the present and future generations?",
      "paragraph": "\"Some people argue that we should research our family history, while others believe we should focus on the present and future generations. This essay will discuss both viewpoints and present my own opinion.\nOn one hand, there are significant benefits to understanding our family's past. One of the most important advantages is the ability to identify genetic diseases like asthma and Down syndrome. Detecting these inherited health issues early allows for timely treatment, potentially saving lives and improving overall quality of life. Additionally, delving into family history can strengthen the bonds among family members. Research often uncovers not only the origins of the family but also the stories of sacrifice and determination that our ancestors displayed in overcoming challenges. These stories can instill a deep sense of pride and belonging in future generations.\nHowever, there are valid reasons to prioritize the present and future generations. The most compelling reason is the need to address urgent contemporary issues such as housing, employment, and nutrition. Tackling these pressing problems can significantly enhance people's living standards, leading to a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. Furthermore, the financial and time resources used for historical research could be better invested in the development of children. Properly nurtured children have the potential to become capable and responsible individuals who not only create prosperity for themselves but also support their family members. Neglecting their development in favor of past research might hinder their growth.\nIn conclusion, both perspectives have their merits. However, I believe that prioritizing the present and future generations is essential due to the urgency of addressing current pressing problems and the significance of nurturing children. Therefore, it is crucial for adult family members to collaborate and create a comprehensive plan for the effective allocation of resources to meet these immediate and important needs.\"\n"

      "paragraph": "There is a prevailing belief that some individuals possess innate leadership abilities, while others contend that leadership skills can be acquired through learning. While it is true that some exceptional leaders have natural talents, I concur that the process of training plays a significant role in shaping great leaders.\nTo begin with, many people are born with certain leadership qualities, such as courage, as an inherent part of their personality. It is important to note that effective leaders must develop the ability to make decisions confidently, which typically evolves over time. They need to demonstrate persistence and not shy away from making choices. Additionally, they must take responsibility for their failures and setbacks. These traits gradually develop as they navigate through life. Therefore, it is essential for leaders to be resolute in defining their goals.\nOn the contrary, proponents of the idea that leadership skills can be learned argue that training programs provide individuals with opportunities to enhance their leadership attributes. For instance, in a professional setting, discipline plays a crucial role in a leader's personal qualities. Such discipline is often instilled through classroom-based training, where participants are required to strictly adhere to schedules and complete challenging tasks. Moreover, various lessons and activities provide them with the chance to hone their problem-solving skills. Regular classroom training, for instance, equips people with the confidence to address unexpected challenges, thanks to the valuable guidance offered by experienced instructors who specialize in specific areas.\nIn conclusion, I believe that there are valid arguments on both sides of this debate. Exceptional leaders with innate qualities, including courage, can indeed make significant contributions to their personal development, which is closely tied to their success as leaders. Simultaneously, there are essential leadership attributes that can be acquired through practical training courses.\n"

      "paragraph": "The global population is swiftly increasing, and consequently, the demand for food is on the rise as well. This essay will explore the reasons behind the escalating demand for food and the steps that the international community can take to address this issue.\nOne of the primary reasons for the heightened demand for food worldwide is the steadily growing global population. As the population continues to expand, so does the need for food. A notable illustration of the connection between population growth and food demand is evident in China's case. Over the past few decades, China's population has grown significantly, leading to a corresponding increase in the demand for food. Additionally, alterations in dietary preferences and an uptick in urbanization have also played a role in the surge in food demand. As people migrate to urban areas, they often adopt more processed, high-calorie diets, which further fuel the demand for food.\nTo address this situation, the international community can implement several measures. Firstly, promoting sustainable agricultural practices can boost food production while minimizing the environmental impact of farming. For example, sustainable farming techniques like conservation tillage, crop diversification, and agroforestry have proven effective in enhancing soil health, reducing erosion, and increasing water efficiency. These practices lead to more sustainable and productive farming systems. Secondly, investing in research and development to enhance crop yields, develop drought-resistant crops, and refine farming methods can enhance agricultural productivity. Through more efficient irrigation systems, improved fertilizers, and better pest control methods, we can assist farmers in producing more food with less land, water, and other resources. This, in turn, contributes to meeting the surging global demand for food.\nIn conclusion, the mounting demand for food worldwide stems from various complex factors. To address this challenge, the international community can adopt measures such as promoting sustainable agriculture, investing in research and development, and minimizing food wastage.\n"

      "paragraph": "Nearly all individuals on Earth live within a community, engaging in a variety of human relationships. Among these, family relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships hold particular importance.\nFirstly, family relationships are established from birth. Families come in various sizes, including immediate families, which consist of parents and their children, and extended families, where multiple generations reside together under one roof. These relationships are formed not only through blood ties but also through legal bonds, such as adoption. Regardless of the type of family one belongs to or how they became part of it, family relationships play a crucial role in upbringing, shaping people's attitudes, and influencing their behavior in later life.\nSocial development is closely linked to personal growth. After family relationships, individuals enter into friendships, often with those of a similar age and shared hobbies during childhood, and common interests and life goals as adults. Friendships are built on shared experiences, and friends are often the ones to whom people confide their secrets when they find it challenging to do so with family members, particularly during adolescence when teenagers spend a significant amount of time at school with their peers. However, it's important to note that not all friends can be trusted equally; true, lasting friendships are developed over time.\nLastly, romantic relationships also play a significant role in most people's lives. People have deep emotional connections with their romantic partners, and these relationships typically progress through phases of love, where passion is strong initially but may diminish over time. In contrast, feelings of trust, emotional intimacy, and commitment tend to grow stronger as the relationship matures beyond the stages of dating and marriage. A key lesson in romantic relationships is learning to respect differences to nurture a lifelong, fulfilling partnership.\nIn conclusion, three primary types of relationships shape human lives: family relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships. Each of these connections offers valuable opportunities for personal growth and development, enabling individuals to become the best versions of themselves and cultivate meaningful, quality relationships with others.\n"

Among these, three fundamental types of relationships stand out: family relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships.\nTo begin with, family relationships are established from birth. People belong to diverse family structures, such as immediate families comprising parents and their children, or extended families where multiple generations reside together. Beyond blood connections, family ties can also be formed through legal bonds, such as adoption. Regardless of the type of family one is a part of or how they became members, family relationships play a pivotal role in upbringing, shaping individuals' attitudes and behaviors as they progress in life.\nAs people grow and develop, their social lives evolve accordingly. Following family relationships, individuals enter into friendships, often with peers of similar age and shared interests, especially during childhood. Over time, friends accumulate shared experiences, and it is not uncommon for people to confide in their closest friends about matters they find challenging to discuss with family members, particularly teenagers who spend a significant amount of time at school with their friends. However, it is important to note that not every acquaintance can be trusted; true, enduring friendships, often referred to as \"best friends,\" are built over time.\nLastly, romantic relationships occupy a significant portion of human lives. People experience unique emotions in their romantic partnerships, which vary based on their love phase. In general, the intensity of passionate feelings tends to diminish as relationships progress, while sentiments of trust, emotional intimacy, and commitment tend to grow stronger beyond the initial stages of knowing each other, dating, and getting married. In romantic relationships, a valuable lesson is to embrace and respect differences in order to maintain a lifelong, fulfilling partnership.\nIn conclusion, there are three primary categories of human relationships that significantly impact one's life: family relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships. Each of these relationships offers opportunities for personal growth and development, helping individuals become the best versions of themselves and fostering high-quality connections with others.\n"

      "paragraph": "There is a debate regarding whether individuals should delve into their family history to learn more about the past, or whether their focus should be on the present and future generations. In this essay, I will discuss both viewpoints and provide reasons for my belief that concentrating on the present and the future is essential for sustainable development.\nSupporters of exploring family history put forward two valid arguments. The primary one is that information about the past carries significant cultural value regarding the traditions and heritage of one's lineage. This knowledge can create an intangible connection to one's ancestors, instilling a sense of belonging and pride. Moreover, people can learn from past mistakes and avoid repeating them. By drawing lessons from their forebears, they can pass on life experiences and wisdom to younger generations, enabling them to make informed decisions when they encounter similar situations.\nHowever, an alternative perspective argues that it is more crucial to be oriented towards the present and the future. The driving force behind this argument is that people can address pressing issues and make necessary adjustments in the ever-evolving world. Modern challenges such as climate change, poverty, and other social problems require immediate action and innovative thinking. Furthermore, many family traditions and beliefs have become outdated and unsuitable for today's society. Therefore, to ensure that social progress is not hindered by obsolete customs and ideologies, people should direct their attention towards the present and future generations. This way, younger individuals can develop their own sets of values and eliminate inappropriate practices.\nIn conclusion, while discovering ancestral backgrounds can help preserve important family cultures and offer invaluable life lessons, I believe that emphasizing the present and future generations is more effective in addressing ongoing challenges and promoting sustainable personal growth. Therefore, I am convinced that contemporary and future age groups should receive more attention from the general public.\n"

In my view, I strongly disagree with this perspective.\nOn one hand, I acknowledge the importance of money in meeting one's basic needs such as housing, food, healthcare, and education. People generally consider earning a sufficient income as a primary means to afford these necessities and maintain a reasonable quality of life. For instance, individuals who pursue careers driven by their passions, like artists and musicians, often struggle financially. While they follow their love, their chosen professions may not provide them with enough income to live comfortably or support a family.\nOn the other hand, I believe that certain factors outweigh monetary considerations when making job choices. Firstly, the quality of personal relationships and the work environment play a pivotal role in job satisfaction. Having supportive managers and congenial colleagues can significantly contribute to one's career growth and overall happiness at work. Secondly, aligning one's career with their educational background and field of study is crucial. When a job aligns with one's major, they are more likely to excel and perform exceptionally in that role. Lastly, many individuals select their professions with the intention of making a positive impact on society and helping others.\nIn conclusion, while salary is undeniably important for meeting basic needs, a strong attachment to one's work and job satisfaction are equally crucial for a fulfilling life.

While some argue that governments should primarily manage medical services, I firmly believe that entrusting this responsibility to private firms offers more advantages.\nOn one hand, government involvement seems reasonable to some extent. This is primarily due to the financial resources available to the state and its ability to mobilize resources, making it crucial in ensuring medical services' availability to the general population. By allocating state funds to establish public hospitals and healthcare centers in underserved areas, governments can guarantee that even the most vulnerable individuals have access to essential medical treatments. In contrast, private companies often prioritize profit generation, which may lead to higher costs and limited accessibility.\nOn the other hand, while government participation in public welfare is undoubtedly essential, I recognize that allowing private companies to manage medical services can provide greater benefits for several compelling reasons. Firstly, the substantial cost of providing healthcare to the community could strain government finances, potentially resulting in budget deficits, tax increases, or reduced social welfare. Consequently, ordinary citizens, especially the underprivileged, may face even greater financial challenges. Furthermore, it is vital to acknowledge that private companies can make significant contributions to the healthcare sector by introducing competition and innovation. This can be further reinforced by the coexistence of private healthcare providers alongside government facilities, fostering a healthy competitive environment that encourages all parties to strive for excellence and improve the quality of care.\nIn conclusion, while the idea of the government taking charge of medical services may appeal to some, I argue that private enterprises should be entrusted with this responsibility.\n"

A prime example is Mike Tyson, whose successful boxing career brought him fame and achievements. However, as he aged, his health deteriorated due to boxing-related issues like osteoporosis and vision problems. Scientific research on Tyson also predicted a decline in his health with age, highlighting the risks associated with this blood sport.\nOn the other hand, despite the potential health drawbacks, I believe boxing has significant value in human life. Training in boxing equips individuals with vital skills that can be used in dangerous situations, such as self-defense against knife-wielding attackers. Additionally, boxing has created numerous career opportunities. Many world-renowned boxers have achieved remarkable success and earned a living through donations or sponsorships from televised competitions.

However, some individuals argue that good health and well-being are essential for everyone, and thus healthcare services should not be overseen by privately-owned profit-driven companies. While this trend has brought certain advantages, I believe that the disadvantages outweigh them.\nOn one hand, private healthcare facilities like hospitals and clinics can alleviate the burden on public medical centers. For instance, during outbreaks such as COVID-19 or the SARS outbreak in 2003, when the number of hospitalized patients surged daily, employing private healthcare services could assist state-owned hospital staff in providing better care for their patients and alleviate the strain on the public healthcare system.\nOn the other hand, I contend that these drawbacks are more significant than the benefits. Firstly, if private companies manage medical services, private health insurance becomes imperative to avoid the high costs. Moreover, this may lead to increased competition among health insurance providers, resulting in higher premiums. Lastly, governments can ensure equitable access to hospitals, while private companies tend to concentrate their hospitals mainly in metropolitan areas because it is challenging to generate profits in smaller, less populated towns.\nIn conclusion, it is my belief that the drawbacks of entrusting medical services to profit-driven companies outweigh the benefits they bring to citizens.

Some argue that the annual disappearance of numerous languages is not a significant issue because it will not hinder communication. From my perspective, I agree with this view that the disappearance of less widely spoken languages is not a crucial problem.\nFirst and foremost, language primarily serves as a means of communication, and the number of speakers plays a pivotal role in this context. English, for example, has become an international language with a large number of speakers, especially after the Industrial Revolution. Consequently, individuals seeking international employment opportunities must possess proficiency in English to enhance their knowledge, career prospects, and financial situations. Therefore, if the global population adopts a common language, many individuals can reduce the educational demands placed upon them. For instance, people can allocate the time they would have spent on language studies to other educational pursuits, and parents would be relieved of the financial burden of enrolling their children in English courses.\nA second reason why I believe that the decline of less widely spoken languages, particularly those of ethnic minorities, is not a problem relates to finances. Moreover, it can enhance individuals' capacity for skill development by affording them the opportunity to access diverse global sources of knowledge. Less commonly spoken languages often hinder many individuals from acquiring valuable knowledge.

In my view, while academic achievements hold undeniable importance, there is room to include practical life skills within the school curriculum through outdoor activities.\nThere are compelling reasons behind the belief in the significance of academic success and exam results. Firstly, strong academic performance opens doors to numerous university opportunities, increasing the chances of students gaining admission to their preferred institutions.

Additionally, schools were originally established with the primary objective of imparting academic knowledge to students, alleviating the need to burden them with the responsibility of acquiring life skills.\nNevertheless, I firmly believe that soft skills and life skills are equally essential for students' future well-being. Firstly, as individuals mature and eventually become independent, they must possess practical skills like cooking and dressmaking to navigate daily life successfully. Such skills equip young adults with the ability to live autonomously without relying on others. Secondly, governments can incorporate outdoor activities into the school curriculum to teach students fundamental life skills, which will prove invaluable in their future endeavors.

Indeed, many schools worldwide do not incorporate work-related instruction into their curriculum.\nOn the other hand, the world of work is better suited for older adolescents, typically around the age of 18. When students decide to pursue tertiary education, it signifies their intent to gain in-depth knowledge in a specific field, which will serve them in their future careers. Consequently, they can simultaneously study academic subjects and engage in internships in various workplaces to gain practical experience. Conversely, for those who do not pursue further education, the age of 18 is an appropriate time to enter the workforce, as they have reached a level of intellectual and physical maturity that makes them better prepared for employment.\nIn conclusion, I oppose the notion that children should spend a brief period working while they are still in school because they lack the necessary maturity for the world of work. The teaching of work-related skills should coincide with their physical and mental development, which typically occurs around the age of 18.\n"

      "question": "To what extent do you agree that the benefits of private healthcare outweigh the drawbacks?",
      "paragraph": "There is a viewpoint that argues that medical services, being essential for human well-being, should not be driven by profit-oriented companies. While there are indeed certain drawbacks to this idea, I believe that the positive impacts outweigh the negatives.\nOn one hand, private healthcare systems do come with some disadvantages. One significant drawback is the steep cost that patients have to bear. This is primarily because private hospitals incur substantial expenses on amenities such as state-of-the-art medical equipment in the operating rooms, deluxe accommodations, and competitive salaries for medical professionals. For instance, consider a pregnant woman who opts for Vinmec, the largest private international hospital in Vietnam; she may end up paying double or even triple the amount compared to a state-run hospital. Consequently, private healthcare can be financially burdensome for individuals who cannot afford these costs, potentially creating an inequality in access to care and treatment.\nOn the other hand, an increasing number of private hospitals today offer various benefits. Firstly, they provide quicker services compared to public health facilities where long waiting lists are often the norm. As a result, both patients with life-threatening conditions and those seeking routine check-ups can receive the treatment they need in a more time-efficient manner. Furthermore, private medical centers expand the options available to individuals facing medical issues. Given the limited number of government-run hospitals and the growing demand for medical services, prompt access to treatment would be a significant challenge without the presence of these private healthcare providers.\nIn conclusion, while private medical companies do have their shortcomings, such as high costs and limited insurance coverage, I argue that they play a crucial role in delivering quality healthcare services to their targeted clientele.\n"

In my view, the benefits of this development far outweigh the drawbacks.\nFirst and foremost, this trend has significantly broadened our horizons and positively impacted society. One notable advantage is that customers can now access a diverse range of high-quality products while discovering the rich cultures of different countries. Additionally, individuals from economically disadvantaged nations can now access the latest products. For instance, Vietnam may have less advanced manufacturing capabilities compared to America, but thanks to international trade, high-tech devices like laptops and smartphones produced in America are accessible to Vietnamese residents. This access to essential utilities has improved their quality of life.\nAnother advantage is the expansion of the market, which helps prevent monopolistic pricing. With a diverse pool of suppliers and traders, competitive prices emerge, benefiting consumers. The competition among providers also encourages them to enhance the quality of their products. For instance, to attract customers to their flagship product, the iPhone, Samsung regularly innovates the design and functionality of their smartphones.\nIn conclusion, despite some minor criticisms, I believe that globalization has given consumers a significant advantage by providing them with a wide array of options from high-quality producers.

      "paragraph": "It is widely acknowledged that government funding should contribute to the improvement of society as a whole. However, there is an ongoing debate about which sector should take precedence when it comes to state subsidies. Some argue that the government should offer its citizens free healthcare, while others believe that these funds should be channeled into education and culture. In this essay, we will examine both perspectives before explaining why I support the latter view.\nOn one hand, it is understandable why some people propose a healthcare system that is free of charge. The primary reason in favor of this idea is that it would enable more people, particularly those who are financially disadvantaged, to access healthcare services. This, in turn, could lead to a healthier population, which is essential for sustainable economic development. However, this line of thinking has its drawbacks, as the substantial costs associated with running a free healthcare system could strain the government's finances, especially in impoverished and developing nations with limited resources. Overspending on healthcare in these countries could result in insufficient funds for other crucial sectors, such as transportation, which could ultimately hinder their economic growth.\nI align myself with those who argue that instead of fully subsidizing healthcare, the government should invest more in culture and education. Regarding culture, increased financial support in this area can help promote national cultural values globally. This is arguably crucial for boosting the national tourism industry, which could, in turn, generate significant revenues for the government. As for education, additional subsidies can enhance the quality of the educational system, potentially leading to a more educated workforce. This undoubtedly serves as a precursor to a thriving economy in the future. When compared to providing free healthcare, investing in education and culture appears to be a more economically advantageous approach.\nIn conclusion, while there are valid reasons to support the implementation of a free healthcare system, I would argue that it would be wiser to allocate those funds to the fields of education and culture.\n"

As a result, there have been calls to forbid programs that showcase violent scenes. In this essay, I find this suggestion entirely reasonable, and I aim to explain my perspective.\nTo begin with, opponents of banning violent broadcasts often argue that it may reduce the appeal of such programs, leading to a decrease in viewership. However, this appeal could potentially result in more severe consequences. For instance, young children may develop aggressive tendencies due to excessive exposure to violence on television.

Consequently, there have been calls to prohibit programs featuring violent scenes. In my view, I wholeheartedly support this idea for the following reasons.\nCritics may argue that eliminating violent scenes would diminish the entertainment value and viewership of the film industry. However, this appeal can lead to severe consequences, including children's exposure to excessive violence, which may nurture misguided perspectives and pose a threat to societal morals. Therefore, prudence must be the foremost consideration when contemplating a ban on televised violence.\nOthers argue that most contemporary movies come with warnings about violence or age appropriateness. According to this perspective, children should learn to choose suitable movies themselves, rather than restricting violent content. Parents, they contend, are responsible for guiding their children's choices and educating them to avoid programs with violent scenes. However, it is challenging for parents to constantly supervise their children to ensure compliance. Hence, implementing a comprehensive prohibition on violence appears to be a safer approach to address this issue.\nIn conclusion, despite the potential drawbacks of banning violent scenes on television, the reasons in favor of such a ban are compelling. Indeed, officially forbidding the depiction of violence on television appears to be the most effective means of protecting children from potential moral degradation.\n"

Consequently, some argue that healthcare services should not be controlled by profit-driven corporations. This essay aims to explore both the advantages and disadvantages of private health care, ultimately concluding that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that medical services provided by private companies can be disadvantageous to a certain extent. The first significant drawback is the exorbitant cost associated with private services, rendering them unaffordable for many individuals. To elaborate further, certain advanced equipment like medical imaging machines or analyzers can inflate expenses two to threefold, limiting access to medical care, particularly for those with financial constraints. Another severe consequence is that the pursuit of profits may lead to unethical practices, such as unnecessary medical procedures or overprescribing medication to generate more revenue. This not only erodes the trust between patients and healthcare providers but also jeopardizes public health.\nNotwithstanding these drawbacks of private health care, I am convinced that the benefits of these organizations are more noticeable, supported by a plethora of compelling reasons. The primary rationale is that patients can reap substantial benefits, including shorter waiting times and access to modern healthcare systems. This can be further reinforced by the fact that personalized medical services with private consultants and doctors save patients time during appointments and offer specialized treatment options. Another justification is that private healthcare providers can significantly alleviate the workload of public medical centers. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the daily number of patients surged, overwhelming state hospitals and straining the public healthcare system.

This essay aims to elucidate the driving factors behind this trend before asserting that it is indeed a positive development.\nThere are two primary reasons why people are inclined to have children later in life. First and foremost, young individuals today prioritize establishing a successful career. To ensure they can comfortably cover various childcare expenses, such as food, education, and clothing, without experiencing financial strain, many young adults opt to first build a financially stable career. For instance, a prosperous couple would be in a position to provide high-quality necessities and services for their children, thereby facilitating their overall development. Another compelling reason is that individuals aspire to enrich their life experiences through activities such as travel and exposure to different lifestyles, which can enhance their parenting skills.\nI would argue that delaying parenthood offers significant advantages for both families and society. Regarding the former, postponed childbirth increases the likelihood of children being raised in an optimal manner. For example, older parents tend to have greater financial resources at their disposal, enabling them to provide their children with access to prestigious educational institutions. Concerning the latter, postponing childbearing can help mitigate various social issues. This viewpoint is reinforced by the fact that couples who become parents later in life often lead happier and more harmonious lives, which can contribute to a lower divorce rate and, consequently, a decrease in crime and domestic violence.\nIn conclusion, the desire to prioritize building a promising career and enhancing parenting skills underpins this trend.

Some argue that the primary purpose of this endeavor is environmental preservation, while others believe it primarily serves business interests. However, I contend that both viewpoints are valid, and international cooperation can simultaneously benefit both aspects.\nThere are numerous compelling reasons why governments have come together to address pressing global issues, particularly environmental concerns. Firstly, the environment is not the exclusive domain of any single country. When pollution occurs in one region, it inevitably impacts surrounding areas and can even have far-reaching global consequences, potentially becoming a widespread phenomenon. Secondly, environmental challenges are often of a catastrophic nature and necessitate collective efforts from diverse nations. For example, addressing the deterioration of environmental quality in developing countries can be accelerated with the assistance of technological advancements from more developed nations.\nNotwithstanding the advantages mentioned above, international collaboration can also be seen as an opportunity for countries to engage in business expansion. Undoubtedly, this endeavor can broaden the scope of trade beyond domestic boundaries, creating favorable conditions for cross-border transactions. For instance, since Vietnam opened up to the world, numerous business agreements have been forged, enticing corporations from developed countries to invest their resources in this nation. Furthermore, thanks to globalization, many businesses operate subsidiaries worldwide, generating numerous job opportunities for local populations. This not only enhances their quality of life but also bolsters the financial strength of these corporations.\nIn conclusion, international cooperation is a significant trend that holds importance for both the economy and the environment, and thus, it should be actively encouraged.\n"

Personally, I agree with the notion that it is crucial to make the most of the older buildings.\nIt is understandable why tax revenue should be invested in newly constructed buildings. Firstly, renovating an existing structure demands significant government funding and involves considerable efforts, in contrast to the creation of a new one. For instance, when renovating Hue's Ancient Capital, a substantial amount of funds was allocated by state officials for facilities and a multitude of experts to preserve its original beauty. Furthermore, the emergence of modern and unique structures boosts the tourism industry by attracting numerous visitors, thereby contributing to national progress in various aspects.\nDespite the numerous advantages of erecting new buildings mentioned above, I am of the opinion that old structures should be repurposed. To begin with, sustainability is a key factor in favor of reusing these buildings. This is because the process of demolishing and constructing numerous new structures is on the verge of exacerbating environmental problems. Hence, to promote a greener future, utilizing the ancient ones is a more viable option. Additionally, historical events have shaped old architecture, making it a reflection of the nation's unique architectural heritage.

Instead, people are encouraged to use public transportation like buses, taxis, and the metro on these vehicle-free days. This essay aims to explore the advantages and disadvantages of this trend and determine whether its benefits outweigh its drawbacks.\nOn one hand, there are some disadvantages to implementing vehicle-free days. Firstly, local residents may experience limited mobility. This means they are restricted to using public transportation, which may not have routes that conveniently connect to their desired destinations. For example, if someone's destination is far from a bus station, they may have to walk a considerable distance to reach it. Furthermore, choosing taxis as an alternative can be expensive compared to using their private vehicles. For instance, a family of four can travel 100km at the cost of a gallon of gasoline in their own car, while commuting the same distance by taxi can amount to several hundred dollars. Secondly, using public transportation on vehicle-free days can result in crowded and sometimes uncomfortable experiences. Commuters have to share the confined space inside public vehicles with many others, which can be distressing, particularly for individuals with claustrophobia. Some people might also face issues such as sexual harassment or unauthorized recording while using public transportation on these days.\nOn the other hand, there are notable advantages to temporarily banning private vehicles in cities. Firstly, governments can make a significant contribution to addressing environmental issues. By prohibiting the use of private vehicles for short periods, there is a substantial reduction in the emission of toxic fumes from vehicles, which helps mitigate the risk of air pollution and maintains a healthier living environment for residents. Additionally, this policy conserves the fuel that would have been used by private vehicles, thus preventing the wastage of natural, non-renewable resources. Furthermore, by promoting the use of public transportation on vehicle-free days, governments can raise awareness among people about eco-friendly travel options, encouraging them to adopt more sustainable modes of commuting. By adjusting their commuting habits, individuals can reduce their ecological footprint, ultimately leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn conclusion, despite the presence of some drawbacks, it is recommended that cities consider implementing vehicle-free days on a permanent basis due to the significant positive effects it has on the environment.\n"

Do you agree or disagree?\"\nImproved Essay:\nWhile some believe that students should engage in homework due to its significance, I acknowledge that this approach may be suitable for many individuals. However, I hold the view that others prioritize extracurricular activities over homework alone.\nOn one hand, there are several reasons why assigning homework is beneficial. One key rationale is that it plays a crucial role in helping teachers assess students' abilities and identify those who require additional support. When a student struggles with their math exercises, it signals a need for the teacher to enhance that student's skills. Furthermore, these assignments not only enable students to practice and reinforce lessons from school but also teach them how to create a well-structured plan based on their class schedule and homework load. Most students who organize their work effectively, complete their homework promptly, and exhibit diligence, dedication, and independence are more likely to enjoy a prosperous and successful life.\nOn the other hand, for many students, homework consumes so much time that they are left with insufficient opportunities for extracurricular activities such as sports or socializing with friends. In many families, especially among Asian parents, the prevailing belief is that a focus on academics is the best path to secure a prosperous future with good job prospects. Consequently, students invest the majority of their time in academics, often neglecting the development of essential soft skills, which are highly valuable. This heavy emphasis on homework can result in children having limited interaction with their parents and even feeling intimidated by them. From a certain perspective, homework can deprive children of their childhood and hinder the development of vital interpersonal skills, such as effective communication.\nIn some developed countries like Finland, homework is either optional or nonexistent, allowing students to pursue their interests and passions freely. This approach has proven to be remarkably effective, as people in such countries tend to possess a wide array of life skills and report high levels of happiness.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that homework can be a vital element for many students, particularly those who are enthusiastic about learning or pursuing in-depth studies, it is not the definitive solution for everyone's engagement in social activities.

Some believe it's beneficial to expand their personal horizons, while others disagree. This essay argues that despite several disadvantages of international exchange visits for students, they are crucial for their long-term development.\nTo start with, having more exchange opportunities offers numerous benefits. Firstly, students can gain high-quality academic knowledge related to their chosen fields. Learning from distinguished professors from around the world can help students understand and apply these lessons effectively. Additionally, participating in these exchange programs exposes students to innovative developments related to their future careers. For instance, exposure to advanced technology during the manufacturing process can enhance their productivity and reduce expenses.

One of the main challenges is cultural shock. Being unfamiliar with the local culture can hinder the learning process and the formation of new friendships. Moreover, it can disrupt their daily routines for an extended period if not managed properly. Furthermore, being far from their hometown during international exchange visits can lead to a loss of identity. For example, when young individuals embrace a new lifestyle and customs, they may tend to forget or disregard their traditional values. In the long term, many long-standing morals and identities may not endure for future generations.\nIn conclusion, while many students can gain a more positive perspective through global exchange visits, it's true that these experiences can pose a threat to national identities and familiarity with one's home environment. In my view, each student should carefully plan to mitigate any unexpected consequences to fully benefit from international exchange visits.\n"

      "question": "To what extent do you agree that personal efforts and luck play a more significant role in achieving success in life than meticulous planning?",
      "paragraph": "Opinions vary regarding whether meticulous planning or other factors have a greater impact on achieving success in life. While detailed planning is undoubtedly crucial, I firmly believe that personal efforts and luck play a more significant role in a successful life.\nThere are two major benefits to having specific plans that play a significant role in achieving favorable outcomes. Firstly, it helps individuals in pursuing their goals. This is because they can set both short-term and long-term objectives with a clear path to motivate them, thus enhancing the execution process. For example, Elon Musk overcame numerous challenges and achieved groundbreaking success with SpaceX due to careful strategic planning. Additionally, detailed planning enables people to stay focused and avoid distractions, which can otherwise hinder their efforts.\nHowever, an alternative perspective suggests that prearranged plans pale in comparison to perseverance and luck. The primary reason for this is that persistence is vital for attaining success. It encourages individuals to acknowledge their limitations and explore alternative paths after encountering unforeseen failures, making them more resilient in overcoming obstacles and pursuing their goals. For instance, Jack Ma tirelessly worked to establish one of China's most successful companies, despite facing various challenges, such as a lack of financial resources. Furthermore, good fortune provides opportunities for growth. It is undeniable that individuals born into affluent families have more chances for personal and career development compared to those from less privileged backgrounds.\nIn conclusion, I believe that both perspectives have their merits. However, on balance, I maintain that diligence and luck are more essential than meticulous planning when it comes to achieving success in life.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's world, maintaining good health is of paramount importance to everyone in society. Consequently, some argue that healthcare services should not be controlled by profit-oriented corporations. This essay aims to examine both the advantages and disadvantages of private healthcare, ultimately concluding that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that medical services provided by private companies can have some disadvantages. One significant drawback is the exorbitant cost associated with private healthcare services, making them unaffordable for many individuals. To elaborate further, the speed and state-of-the-art equipment of these services can drive up the expenses, limiting access to medical care, particularly for those with financial constraints. Another serious concern is that profit-driven decisions may lead to unethical practices in healthcare. For instance, in profit-oriented healthcare systems, financial considerations may take precedence over patient needs, potentially resulting in over-treatment or unnecessary medical procedures.\nHowever, despite these drawbacks, I am convinced that the advantages of private healthcare organizations outweigh these disadvantages for several compelling reasons. Firstly, patients can benefit greatly from shorter waiting times and modern healthcare systems. This is reinforced by the fact that private healthcare services can offer personalized consultations with doctors, helping patients save time on appointments and receive specialized treatment. Another justification is that private healthcare can alleviate the workload of public medical centers. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in the number of patients seeking medical attention, overwhelming state hospitals and burdening the public healthcare system. Private healthcare services can play a vital role in addressing such situations.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that medical services operated by profit-making companies can have several disadvantages, I maintain that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.\n"

      "paragraph": "Imprisonment is often considered a more effective solution than education to prevent crimes. In my opinion, although investing in educational resources can lower crime rates to a certain extent, severe punishments still play a more crucial role in surmounting this persistent problem.\nProponents of education argue for its positive impact on society in the long term. The motives for criminal activity are often deeply rooted in underlying factors, ranging from poverty to a lack of access to formal education. Therefore, governments can allocate funds to ensure free and accessible education for individuals from impoverished backgrounds, improving their chances of obtaining well-paid jobs. There is anecdotal evidence that in countries with low crime rates, such as Singapore and Canada, the general population has easy access to education and is thus less likely to resort to criminal means for support.\nHowever, imprisonment is justifiable as it best ensures public safety. Firstly, criminals cannot continue committing crimes when they are serving sentences in jails. Isolating criminals is the best way to protect society for extended periods, especially in cases of convicted murderers, rapists, kidnappers, and other serious offenses, eliminating even the slightest chance these criminals will continue to harm other individuals. Sentencing criminals to prisons can also effectively deter criminal acts. Those with the intention of engaging in illegal activities will naturally have to consider the risk of potentially losing their freedom. This is exemplified in nations with severe sentencing laws, such as Vietnam, where the government sentences illegal drug traffickers to life imprisonment and has successfully reduced the number of drug-related incidents as a result.\nIn conclusion, while educational provision can partially reduce crime rates, putting offenders in jails is by far the most effective form of deterrence. Governments should naturally combine both methods to achieve the most desirable outcomes.\n"

      "question": "To what extent do you agree that a person's true worth should be determined by their character rather than external factors such as social standing and material possessions?",
      "paragraph": "In today's contemporary society, there is a prevalent belief that a person's value is often assessed based on their social standing and material possessions. Consequently, qualities like ethics, integrity, and wisdom are no longer held in high regard. From my perspective, I wholeheartedly concur with the idea that an individual's true worth should be determined by their character rather than external factors. This essay will elaborate on the key points supporting this notion.\nTo begin with, social status and wealth do not contribute significantly to long-term personal growth. This is because class and monetary wealth are contingent upon individuals' efforts to accumulate and maintain them. However, not all individuals in privileged positions can sustain their status if they lack the requisite abilities and the approval of the people around them. Furthermore, it is predicted that in the near future, currency may become obsolete due to improved living conditions for residents. According to Karl Marx, after the era of capitalism, the world will transition into socialism, guaranteeing a contented life for citizens, rendering the concepts of money and social classes unnecessary.\nDelving deeper into this notion, it can be persuasively argued that human qualities play a pivotal role in achieving success. When an individual consistently treats others with kindness and offers help to the best of their abilities, they are likely to receive support from those they have assisted, expediting their path to success. Consequently, they earn praise and respect from their peers and reap financial rewards from their achievements.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that human virtues should be universally acknowledged as the true criteria for evaluating a person's worth. Therefore, individuals should prioritize nurturing their good conduct and attitudes to become exemplary citizens.\n"

      "paragraph": "Workforce competition between older and younger individuals vying for the same jobs is currently a noteworthy concern. In my view, this phenomenon can have unfavorable implications for the labor market. Therefore, it is crucial for governments and companies to take action to address these issues.\nThe rising rate of unemployment among the youth, which can result from the aforementioned trend, is a significant concern. Younger workers, with less experience, may encounter challenges in distinguishing themselves and gaining recognition comparable to their older counterparts, who are generally perceived as more experienced. Consequently, youth unemployment can lead to social issues, such as homelessness and juvenile delinquency. Furthermore, as individuals age, their health may deteriorate, potentially limiting their capacity to handle multiple tasks and requiring greater mental focus, which can result in reduced productivity.\nTo address the problem of youth unemployment, businesses should actively promote more internship opportunities for less experienced young employees. In Vietnam, numerous universities have established partnerships with businesses that offer apprenticeships or exchange programs to help students enhance their skills. By gaining practical knowledge through these initiatives, students can significantly increase their chances of securing employment. Another effective approach is to improve the quality of life for the elderly by implementing comprehensive welfare programs. For instance, instead of relying on employment for healthcare expenses, the elderly can receive healthcare services from the government, including home visits and outpatient rehabilitation services.\nIn conclusion, intergenerational competition for employment opportunities can lead to youth unemployment and reduced productivity. This underscores the importance of collaboration between the government and private companies to address these challenges.\n"

Therefore, some people argue that a sport as extreme as boxing is inappropriate in the modern age due to the physical injuries it frequently inflicts upon its participants. From my perspective, I strongly agree with this viewpoint for several reasons.\nTo begin with, it is undeniable that boxing matches showcased in the media often emphasize moral principles and provide a spectacle that includes respect for opponents, adherence to rules, and fair play. However, underground boxing, which appeals to a particular audience, is often marred by disturbing elements such as foul language, disregard for opponents, violent punches, brutal scenes, and an unseemly appearance resulting from intense physical contact. Consequently, this perilous sport is ill-suited to exist in today's world.\nAnother compelling reason supporting my agreement with this perspective is the case of Mike Tyson, a prominent American boxer with numerous noteworthy accomplishments in his career. As Tyson grew older, he began to suffer from serious health issues stemming from his past boxing matches, including osteoporosis and vision-related problems. Furthermore, scientific studies on Tyson's health indicated that he was unlikely to fully recover from the injuries incurred during his boxing career, exacerbated by the natural aging process. In this context, I would argue that this hazardous sport poses a significant threat to the physical well-being of its participants and should be banned on safety grounds.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that eliminating boxing is a reasonable and responsible course of action due to the detrimental impact it has on the physical health of its athletes.\n"

The level of copper in the blood, which includes both ceruloplasmin-bound and non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper, is typically low when WD is diagnosed in non-acute cases. However, in WD-related ALF, it is likely to be high because non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper is released from the failing liver. Additionally, urinary copper production should be very high. When examining the liver tissue through a biopsy, we often observe multi-lobular confluent necrosis, which is consistently present alongside cirrhosis.

This essay will explore both perspectives and explain why music should not be reduced to a mere form of entertainment.\nThose who believe that music is solely for entertainment often point to the way it is consumed in our daily lives. Indeed, a considerable number of people now tend to prefer songs that follow a predictable formula and provide instant gratification, without delving into deeper meanings. This has resulted in an inundation of repetitive and clich?d music that enjoys popularity among listeners but frequently faces criticism from experts. A prime example of this phenomenon can be observed in K-pop, one of the world's largest music industries, which has been criticized for heavily following trends and fads, potentially leading to a lack of originality in both music and performances.\nHowever, music also serves as a powerful tool for conveying essential messages and challenging stereotypes. Singers and composers can use their music to express their viewpoints and garner support from fans who share their beliefs. For instance, \"Beds are Burning\" by Midnight Oil, focusing on land rights and the mistreatment of Indigenous communities by white Australians, became a global sensation upon its release. It was one of the pioneering songs that raised awareness about racism and inspired others to advocate for a more equitable society through their lyrics and melodies.

Some argue that computers enhance the educational experience, making it more enjoyable and effective for students, while others are concerned that excessive reliance on computers can have negative physical and emotional consequences for students. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and share my own opinion.\nOn one hand, there are several reasons why digital tools can aid students in their studies. Firstly, computers provide students with access to a vast amount of information. For example, when they encounter difficulties or confusion, they can search for answers on the Internet with a high degree of accuracy, even without the immediate assistance of teachers. Secondly, students can attend virtual lessons through computer screens. This not only ensures the quality of instruction but also saves a significant amount of time and money that would otherwise be spent on commuting.\nOn the other hand, some argue that prolonged exposure to computers can lead to potential health issues and hinder the development of essential life skills. Specifically, excessive computer use, without sufficient interaction with peers and the real world, can weaken students' eyesight and make them less adept at handling complex, real-life problems. However, if students use digital devices responsibly and are guided and supported by their parents, many of these adverse effects can be mitigated and corrected. Therefore, the benefits of computers in education are likely to outweigh the drawbacks.\nIn conclusion, the use of computers in education has become increasingly prevalent, with both supporters and detractors presenting valid arguments. In my view, I wholeheartedly support the idea that students can have a more enjoyable and efficient learning experience through the use of high-quality digital tools.\n"

      "paragraph": "Every country has its own medical system, with some being managed by the government and others by private companies. There is an ongoing debate about whether governments or private companies should oversee medical services. In my view, I completely agree that governments should be responsible for medical services, and this essay will explain why.\nFirst and foremost, when governments are in charge of medical systems, everyone has an equal opportunity to access healthcare, regardless of their financial situation. To illustrate, in some cases, like in the USA, when private companies took control of medical services from the government, the prices for services such as general check-ups and surgeries increased significantly. Consequently, it has become financially burdensome for people to seek medical treatment.\nSecondly, if private companies manage medical services, private health insurance becomes essential to cover the high costs. Moreover, intense competition among health insurance companies is likely to drive prices up. Lastly, governments can ensure that hospitals are evenly distributed across the country. In contrast, private companies tend to establish hospitals only in bustling cities, as it is challenging to generate profits in smaller, quieter towns.\nIn conclusion, there are several compelling reasons why medical services should be administered by governments. They can provide equitable access to healthcare, regardless of a person's wealth or location. Additionally, private insurance should remain optional rather than mandatory for receiving medical services.\n"

From my perspective, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint due to the significance of both aspects for several reasons.\nOn one hand, there are compelling reasons why the outward appearance holds paramount importance. Firstly, it is crucial to ensure that a building complies with government regulations. In various residential areas, authorities often mandate uniform architectural styles to maintain a harmonious community environment. This approach contributes to the overall comfort and cohesion of society. Furthermore, numerous recreational establishments prioritize attractive designs to entice customers. For instance, most shopping centers invest in appealing aesthetics to draw in shoppers. Thanks to their pleasing appearances, they can increase their revenue and enhance their reputation.\nOn the other hand, it is evident that functionality also plays a vital role in constructing a building. Firstly, it greatly contributes to the safety of the building's occupants. One of the most crucial functions is ensuring the house's sustainability, creating a secure living environment for its residents. Secondly, a well-thought-out functional design allows family members to carry out their daily routines with ease. For example, in densely populated urban areas, spacious residences covering a substantial area often cater to the preferences of a majority of the population.\nIn conclusion, while there is an ongoing debate regarding whether function or outward appearance takes precedence in building design, I believe that both aspects are indispensable factors in creating the ideal dwelling.\n"

      "paragraph": "In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the number of people learning foreign languages. Some argue that the sole purpose of acquiring these languages is for traveling to other countries or improving one's chances of finding work abroad. However, others contend that there are broader reasons for learning a foreign language. This essay will explore both perspectives before offering my own viewpoint on the matter.\nUndoubtedly, being proficient in multiple languages can indeed be valuable for those who wish to travel abroad or seek employment in foreign countries. The most obvious advantage is the potential to reduce the likelihood of miscommunications or misunderstandings while traveling or working in a foreign environment. Additionally, many international companies require their employees to be fluent in languages other than their native tongue, particularly English. Consequently, individuals with language proficiency may have an edge in securing financially rewarding positions, which can significantly improve their quality of life by ensuring the ability to meet their basic needs and personal interests.\nHowever, it is essential to recognize that the benefits of learning a foreign language extend far beyond these practical advantages. One significant benefit is the enhancement of global mutual understanding. In today's interconnected world, people from different countries often engage in face-to-face interactions. Proficiency in a common language, such as English, can help bridge language barriers and promote better communication, ultimately fostering international friendships.\nAnother notable advantage is the opportunity to gain a deeper and broader understanding of various cultures and histories. It is undeniable that a significant portion of the world's history and culture is recorded in widely spoken languages. Consequently, individuals who excel in these languages can gain profound insights into the cultures and histories associated with them, which can be highly beneficial if they decide to live in or engage with these nations.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that learning a foreign language for the sole purpose of traveling or working abroad can offer certain advantages, it is evident that the benefits of acquiring foreign languages for various purposes are undeniable.

However, I respectfully disagree with this perspective, and I firmly believe that we should continue to protect wild animals due to their valuable contributions to our world.\nFirstly, the presence of wild animals plays a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance. When a species nears extinction, it disrupts the delicate web of life, causing cascading effects on other organisms. For instance, the European Bison plays a pivotal role in regulating vegetation growth in its habitat. If the Bison were to disappear, the floristic composition of their environment would suffer, potentially triggering various problems related to climate change. Additionally, wild animals in their natural habitats contribute to enhancing soil health and fertility. Certain animals, such as hippos, actively improve soil conditions through their digging activities, enriching the mineral content of the soil.\nFurthermore, the preservation of wild animals is essential for advancing medical research. Despite our advanced medical and technological capabilities, some drugs and vaccines still require experimentation on animals due to their shared biological characteristics with humans. Animal testing has resulted in numerous life-saving cures and treatments, including breakthroughs in the treatment of diseases like breast cancer and brain injuries.\nIn conclusion, taking into account the aforementioned factors, the conservation of wild animals remains of utmost importance because of their roles in ecological balance, soil health, and scientific research.

In my perspective, I firmly concur with this notion for the following reasons.\nTo commence, money plays a pivotal role in sustaining one's livelihood. The cost of living in urban and coastal regions has escalated significantly in recent decades. Take Vietnam, for instance, where room rents have surged from mere hundreds in the 2000s to millions by 2010, with further increases anticipated. Consequently, individuals are compelled to exert more effort in order to afford their accommodations. A poignant example is a female teacher in Vietnam who reluctantly abandoned her cherished profession due to financial distress. When asked about her salary, she welled up with tears, lamenting that the meager income could not cover her bills or provide for her children. In summary, it is evident that in this era of soaring living costs, a substantial salary outweighs job satisfaction.\nFurthermore, a generous income serves as a potent motivator, regardless of the nature of one's occupation. Money is perceived as a powerful incentive, propelling individuals to perform at their best. Upon completing their education, graduates invariably seek positions that offer the desired remuneration, regardless of the job's demands. Consequently, when offered a substantial salary, individuals are inclined to work diligently, alleviating their financial burdens. Additionally, well-compensated employees are more likely to remain in the workforce for extended periods. This, in turn, contributes to a greater number of active workers, increased production of goods and services, and an overall enhancement of living standards and economic prosperity.\nIn conclusion, a profession that provides a substantial income undeniably holds greater appeal than one that solely caters to inner satisfaction.

I firmly believe that having ambition is essential, and it is a favorable trait when practiced within reasonable boundaries.\nIt is essential to recognize that harboring specific ambitions provides individuals with a sense of purpose in life. This is evident in the behavior of unemployed individuals who, when contentedly living off unemployment benefits, often feel aimless and end up engaging in unproductive activities like prolonged television watching, gossiping, or even committing minor crimes like vandalism. These activities ultimately lead to trouble for themselves, their families, and their communities as a whole. However, sociologists, psychologists, and psychoanalysts have definitively demonstrated that when such individuals set concrete goals for themselves, they can often transform their lives and become productive contributors to society. This underscores the significance of striving to attain specific achievements or milestones in one's life.\nI am convinced that ambition is generally a positive characteristic when employed sensibly. While there are cases where some individuals pursue unattainable goals, resulting in mental and physical exhaustion, psychological issues such as anxiety and depression, diminished self-esteem, and even suicidal thoughts, such instances are exceptions. Under normal circumstances, where ambition is channeled responsibly, it motivates individuals to aim for excellence and achieve more in life. For instance, students aspiring to excel in their studies tend to be more focused and achieve better academic results than their less academically driven peers. Similarly, athletes with aspirations to break world records in their respective sports have heightened motivation to practice and compete. Even if they do not ultimately establish new world records, their skills generally far surpass those who lack such ambitious aspirations.

Although this perspective has some merit, I believe that people should be allowed to take part in these activities as long as certain safety precautions are in place.\nIt's understandable why some people argue for government restrictions on extreme sports. The main reason behind this is the inherent danger associated with these exciting recreational activities. For instance, these intense games can pose serious risks to players' physical well-being in the long term, such as bone fractures, head trauma, and even life-threatening injuries in the worst-case scenarios. Another argument in favor of prohibiting risky sports is that it perpetuates social inequality. This is evident when we consider that only a small proportion of the population with abundant financial resources can afford to participate. The high costs involved, including participation fees and insurance expenses, discourage ordinary individuals with modest incomes from engaging in these activities.\nDespite the arguments supporting the need for governments to ban dangerous sports, I believe that adventurous individuals should be given the opportunity to engage in these activities under certain conditions, such as close supervision and the use of protective equipment. This is because, with the right gear and thorough examination by specialized experts, the likelihood of serious injuries can be significantly reduced. Additionally, professional athletes who have undergone rigorous training with their coaches can participate in official competitions, as they have been properly instructed and understand the risks involved. By doing so, they can pursue their passion and be rewarded with certificates of merit, medals, and even cash prizes, which serve as incentives for them to strive for international recognition.\nIn conclusion, while there are compelling arguments for a complete ban on extreme sports based on safety concerns, I believe that governments should authorize well-qualified participants who take sensible precautions. By striking a balance between safety measures and individual freedom, we can ensure that individuals can pursue their adventurous interests while minimizing the risks involved.\n"

      "question": "Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of traveling to remote and untouched regions like Antarctica.",
      "paragraph": "In the 21st century, owing to advances in technology and transportation, an increasing number of researchers and tourists can now explore remote and untouched regions like Antarctica. While this trend offers some notable advantages, I believe that its disadvantages are more prominent.\nAdmittedly, the growing popularity of traveling to remote areas can bring substantial benefits. Firstly, from a scientific standpoint, researchers exploring these pristine regions can make significant contributions to scientific breakthroughs. For instance, these areas host unique and diverse ecosystems, along with valuable minerals and metals that hold the potential for future societal development. Moreover, for tourists, this trend provides an opportunity for a once-in-a-lifetime travel experience. Specifically, it allows them to escape the urban hustle and bustle, immersing themselves in natural environments where they can closely encounter wild flora and fauna. This can foster a profound appreciation for nature and contribute to raising public awareness about wildlife conservation.\nHowever, despite these advantages, I contend that the disadvantages of this trend are more significant. Firstly, there is a risk of witnessing a gradual decline in elusive species, which could disrupt the ecosystem. Hunting, for example, may lead to the loss of natural beauty in these regions as scientists capture and sometimes harm animals for research purposes. Another significant drawback is the potential danger faced by tourists who lack a deep understanding of these remote locations and their wildlife. Such individuals may struggle to navigate accurately, risking getting lost or encountering wild animals, which could lead to life-threatening situations. Furthermore, tourists may be susceptible to severe health issues such as colds, fevers, or even mortality due to extreme temperatures, as they may not have sufficient time to adapt.\nIn conclusion, while there are undeniable benefits to traveling to remote areas, including scientific advancement and unique experiences, I believe that the drawbacks, such as ecosystem imbalance and safety concerns, outweigh the advantages.\n"

      "question": "Should governments prioritize defense spending over social benefits?",
      "paragraph": "In today's world, governments have a fundamental duty to guarantee the safety of their citizens. Balancing expenditures between defense and social benefits is a critical aspect of this responsibility. I firmly believe that prioritizing defense spending over social benefits is essential, and I will elucidate several reasons for this stance in this essay.\nA larger defense budget can yield positive results in curbing terrorism and controlling illegal immigration. Firstly, numerous terrorist organizations have perpetrated deadly attacks worldwide in recent decades, claiming the lives of innocent civilians. For instance, the tragic events of September 11, 2001, stand as a poignant example of a terrorist attack that resulted in the tragic loss of thousands of lives. Furthermore, illegal immigration has adverse effects on both the economy and society, with a significant portion of the national budget being expended on education, healthcare, and housing for undocumented immigrants. Consequently, converting social welfare spending into defense funds can help prevent terrorists and illegal immigrants from entering the country, addressing these pressing issues.\nOn the other hand, social welfare programs impose various taxes on citizens, which can have negative repercussions. Many families aspire to own a home, but the soaring house prices make this dream increasingly unattainable, primarily due to high housing taxes. Consequently, a substantial increase in homelessness among citizens becomes evident as housing becomes less affordable.\nIn conclusion, it is imperative for governments to allocate more resources to defense while reducing spending on social benefits to fulfill their responsibility of safeguarding national security. Terrorism and illegal immigration are compelling reasons to support this viewpoint. I personally recommend that every government carefully reconsiders its budget allocation to ensure the safety and well-being of its citizens.\n"

      "paragraph": "In recent times, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of individuals who allocate insufficient time to their family members. I firmly believe that this rising trend can be attributed to various factors and can also have adverse consequences for individuals and families in the long term.\nTo begin with, there are several underlying reasons explaining why people spending less time with their families has become more common. Firstly, the widespread use of digital platforms, particularly among the younger generation, has led to people becoming socially isolated from their loved ones. Numerous entertainment platforms have piqued people's interest and absorbed their attention. An illustrative example of this trend can be observed among many young people in Vietnam, who prefer immersing themselves in the cyber world, such as Tik Tok and Facebook, rather than devoting time to engage in conversations or interact with their families.\nSecondly, people often find themselves caught up in demanding work schedules, working overtime or even night shifts to support their livelihoods. As a result, they struggle to find time for personal commitments, let alone spending time with their family members.\nFurthermore, differences in generational stereotypes and conflicts between age groups can lead to a lack of understanding, causing one generation to be less sympathetic towards the problems of another. This generation gap can result in disputes and make life less enjoyable for all parties involved.\nThe trend of spending less time with loved ones can have several implications for individuals and families alike. Individuals who are not close to their families are more likely to choose solitary lifestyles and may experience mental health issues such as depression and anxiety disorders. Without quality time spent together, families may drift apart, leading to misunderstandings and even conflicts.\nIn conclusion, the increase in spending less time with family members can be attributed to personal entertainment choices, demanding work schedules, and generational differences. Ultimately, this trend has negative effects on both individuals' well-being and society as a whole.\n"

      "paragraph": "Nowadays, the issue of animal rights is gaining increasing prominence in society. Some individuals contend that the practice of confining animals in wildlife parks is morally wrong, while others believe that zoos offer both entertainment and ecological significance. In my opinion, this essay will carefully examine both sides of this debate before presenting a conclusion.\nOn the one hand, there are several advantages to keeping animals in captivity. Firstly, zoos play a crucial role in the preservation of endangered animals. This is because many rare species that are scarce in the wild face the threat of poaching or are unable to maintain viable populations without human protection. For example, pandas are often targeted by poachers due to the value of their body parts. By housing pandas in zoos, the risk of their extinction is significantly reduced. Additionally, wildlife parks offer valuable educational opportunities for children. When young people visit zoos, they can learn about a wide variety of creatures from around the world, which can inspire them to expand their knowledge.\nOn the other hand, many people argue that keeping animals in captivity is inherently cruel. First and foremost, wildlife parks can disrupt an animal's natural behaviors. This is often the result of individuals lacking the necessary knowledge to properly care for animals, which can lead to animals suffering both mentally and physically. To illustrate, animals in zoos are often confined to small enclosures where they have limited space to move and engage in natural behaviors. This confinement can result in animals becoming cramped or even developing health issues due to the lack of exercise.\nIn conclusion, while some individuals believe that confining animals in wildlife reserves is ethically wrong, others contend that zoos provide both entertainment and important ecological benefits. Zoos can continue to offer educational and conservation advantages, but it is crucial for them to strike a balance between the well-being of the animals and their conservation priorities.\n"

Conversely, there is an opposing viewpoint that argues for schools as the primary institutions for instilling such knowledge. In my view, I align with the former perspective as I believe that the family serves as the foundation for each individual, and caregivers should be the ones to instill this vital knowledge.\nOn one hand, schools are indeed appropriate venues for educating students, as they not only offer a wide range of academic knowledge but also equip young learners with essential life skills necessary to become responsible citizens. To be more specific, the government in Vietnam, recognizing the significance of imparting fundamental life skills alongside academic education, has implemented practical strategies to encourage teachers nationwide to provide additional life lessons. As a result, students can acquire not only critical skills but also engage in engaging lessons, thereby enhancing their concentration.\nOn the other hand, some argue that the instruction on becoming good members of society at school may be overly theoretical and disconnected from real-life experiences. Instead, acquiring these essential skills at home can prove to be more advantageous for children. For instance, the home environment is an ideal setting for parents to educate their offspring about being responsible members of society since parents are more intimately connected to their children than anyone else. Consequently, they possess a deeper understanding of their children's unique characteristics and can tailor their guidance to address weaknesses and bolster strengths effectively.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that schools offer students a wealth of valuable information. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that children are better served when their parents take an active role in educating them about how to become exemplary members of our society.\n"

      "paragraph": "Many young people today possess a greater familiarity with famous individuals from the entertainment industry, such as international pop and movie stars, rather than renowned historical figures within their own nation. This essay aims to identify the primary factors contributing to this phenomenon, namely the influence of media and uninspiring teaching methods, and then propose a more effective approach to address this issue.\nThis trend can be attributed to several key factors. Firstly, the media plays a pivotal role in this preference, as it consistently highlights information about well-known celebrities due to their current prominence in society. Consequently, young individuals, who naturally have a curiosity about current events, are drawn to these popular figures who are prominently featured in the media on a daily basis. Moreover, this inclination is further exacerbated by the conventional teaching methods employed in history education. Typically, history is presented in a traditional manner, involving the rote memorization of dates and events, which fails to ignite students' interest in historical personalities and their contributions. In essence, educators often emphasize the memorization of historical events and timelines as the cornerstone of historical learning, perpetuating a fixed and outdated teaching approach.\nA viable solution to this issue involves encouraging educational institutions to incorporate innovative teaching methods into their curricula. Instead of relying solely on conventional approaches, educational videos and visual aids should be integrated into lectures to captivate students' interest in history. This approach can foster an engaging learning environment, leading to significantly improved academic outcomes. For instance, in addition to providing background information about historical events, such as significant victories or pivotal battles, educational materials can include images of the leaders or individuals who played pivotal roles in these historical events. This visual approach enables students to gain a comprehensive understanding of historical events by connecting them with the individuals who shaped the course of history.\nIn conclusion, the growing disparity between young people's knowledge of international pop or movie stars and their ignorance of historical figures is a genuine concern. This phenomenon is primarily driven by the influence of the media and the uninspiring teaching methods used in history education. However, there is a promising solution to this issue: the implementation of more engaging and interactive teaching techniques that can rekindle students' interest in their nation's history.\n"

      "paragraph": "It is believed by some that online learning will eventually replace traditional face-to-face learning. From my perspective, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint.\nFirstly, individuals engaged in face-to-face study have the valuable opportunity to interact with their teacher in real-time. During in-person learning sessions, questions receive immediate responses, whereas online learning often requires waiting for answers. Research indicates that face-to-face learning yields better academic performance than e-learning. The dynamic interaction between educators and students lies at the heart of the educational process.\nSecondly, face-to-face learning cultivates focused attention among learners. In contrast, online learning can easily lead to boredom, as learners tend to be more passive, primarily listening. In physical classrooms, educators can engage students in various interactive activities that encourage active learning. For instance, students are typically not allowed to use smartphones unless permitted by their teachers, and educators can closely observe and monitor their students. Conversely, online learners may become distracted by private interests, like texting friends or playing games. Consequently, this can hinder their educational progress.\nThirdly, in-person learning offers opportunities to acquire vital skills through classes and extracurricular activities such as clubs, including communication skills, presentation skills, and problem-solving skills. The classroom serves as a microcosm of society, bringing together a diverse group of individuals who learn together. Consequently, direct learning not only imparts specialized knowledge but also hones essential soft skills, such as building new friendships and working collaboratively in groups. Therefore, learners benefit not only from their teachers but also from the diverse perspectives of their classmates.\nIn conclusion, while online learning certainly presents advantages, it is not sufficiently compelling to entirely replace traditional face-to-face learning. Consequently, in-person learning remains an effective and valuable educational approach in the long run.\n"

      "paragraph": "Some individuals argue that university students should be free to choose courses that align with their personal interests. In contrast, others assert that they should be limited to studying subjects with potential future benefits, particularly those related to science and technology. While I understand the reasoning behind supporting the latter perspective, I personally favor the former viewpoint.\nOn one hand, proponents of narrowing the range of subjects available to students have valid reasons. From their standpoint, a restricted selection of courses can enhance a student's focus, potentially leading to more efficient learning and a shorter duration of study. For example, students exclusively focusing on compulsory subjects are likely to graduate sooner than those who pursue their own preferences. Another aspect to consider is that concentrating on a narrower set of subjects is less challenging than covering a wide array of topics, which can potentially result in improved average scores.\nOn the other hand, I align with those who believe students should have the freedom to study subjects they are passionate about. One significant reason for this is that when students genuinely engage with their chosen subjects, they tend to acquire a broader knowledge base compared to those who exclusively focus on specific disciplines. Consequently, this expanded knowledge can create more career opportunities for them. Another crucial advantage is their increased adaptability, stemming from their diverse knowledge base. This adaptability makes it easier for them to find jobs that align with their interests. For instance, recent graduates with a broad knowledge base can readily adapt to various roles and have better prospects for career advancement.\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the reasons behind advocating for students to study only subjects with future utility, I remain firm in my belief that students should be granted the freedom to choose their courses based on their personal interests.\n"

Every coin has two sides, so I believe that there are both negative and positive impacts on youngsters who decide to do this.\nIn terms of working, there are several reasons why high school graduates should be encouraged to work before embarking on their university journey. To begin with, they can have opportunities to try jobs related to their future careers. This can help them gauge whether they have the necessary skills and aptitude for university studies. Moreover, individuals who have already gained work experience in fields related to their university majors can find employment more easily after graduating, as employers seek well-qualified and competent staff for their organizations. However, it's essential to note that if they find jobs with higher salaries, young people may become distracted and lose motivation to continue their studies.\nRegarding traveling, personally, I believe the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. On the one hand, taking a break and relaxing after years of studying can refresh the mind, allowing students to recharge their batteries. Consequently, they may not feel overwhelmed by the heavy workload of university studies. On the other hand, travel can have a negative impact on students' motivation. Some high school graduates tend to procrastinate their tasks, often due to the enjoyment they find in travel experiences. This can lead to a decrease in ambition and motivation to excel academically. Additionally, some students may encounter financial constraints that prevent them from covering their university tuition fees.\nIn conclusion, although it might seem sensible for undergraduates to gain work experience or embark on travel adventures before starting their university studies, I personally believe that there are certain disadvantages to consider.\n"

While there are advantages to watching TV, I would argue that reading offers a wide range of benefits for individuals.\nOn the one hand, television serves as both entertainment and a source of educational content for children. Primarily, people tend to turn to TV after work or school to relax and improve their ability to depict real-life scenarios vividly. For example, children can explore different perspectives on the world through children's programs on TV, which provide them with a unique lens through which to view the world. However, it's worth noting that many advertisements can be distracting and annoying for viewers during programs. These ads are typically purchased by businesses aiming to convey as much product information as possible without considering viewers' feedback.\nOn the other hand, reading for pleasure can aid individuals in nurturing their imagination and enhancing their language skills in several ways. One rationale behind this is that reading stimulates the brain, requiring readers to employ their imagination to visualize the story's characters and settings. Additionally, reading can promote critical and creative thinking, improve logical reasoning, and contribute to the development of creative and intelligent individuals. Another point to emphasize is that reading can significantly boost language skills by expanding one's vocabulary and writing abilities. For example, toddlers who engage in daily reading activities can enhance their reading comprehension skills and better understand fairy tales compared to their peers.\nIn conclusion, while there are valid reasons why people may prefer watching TV, I firmly believe that reading offers individuals numerous potential benefits in their lives.\n"

      "paragraph": "In our modern society, some individuals choose to discard old belongings rather than preserving and reusing them as was the practice in the past. This shift can be attributed to two primary factors: increased financial stability and the desire for new possessions. While there are certain advantages to this change, it also brings about various impacts on people's attitudes.\nOne of the primary reasons behind the transition towards not retaining outdated items is the improved financial situation of individuals. Nowadays, people earn more money than they did in the past, thanks to their jobs and additional sources of income. This financial stability allows them to purchase new clothing and household items without much concern. For instance, if parents notice that their children's clothing has become soiled and torn, they readily purchase new outfits for their sons or daughters.\nThe second reason contributing to this shift is the desire to possess new items. In today's world, the influence of social media has grown at an unprecedented rate, with most people using it daily. Consequently, individuals are exposed to the lifestyles of others more frequently. When they see their friends acquiring new cars, smart devices, or household items, they often experience a sense of envy, prompting them to make similar purchases.\nTurning to the effects of this change on people's behavior, both positive and negative consequences emerge. On the positive side, people's inclination to discard outdated possessions rather than reusing or recycling them indicates that they are living more comfortably and earning money more easily than in the past. However, on the negative side, this behavior signifies a lack of attention to savings. Not only are individuals neglecting the proper care of their belongings, but they are also squandering their resources unnecessarily. Consequently, if this trend continues unchecked, people may become increasingly wasteful in their spending habits.\nIn conclusion, the tendency to abandon outdated possessions is driven by increased financial stability and the desire for new acquisitions, often influenced by social comparisons. This change has both positive and negative effects on people's behavior, illustrating the need for a balanced approach to consumption and financial management.\n"

Many opt for fast food over balanced meals. However, it's crucial to recognize that fast food often contains an abundance of food preservatives and harmful substances. Overindulging in fast food is strongly associated with various health issues, such as stomach cancer and heart diseases. Therefore, it is imperative to reconsider our eating habits, with an emphasis on incorporating wholesome foods like vegetables and fruits, which are rich in essential nutrients and vitamins. These natural foods not only enhance our overall health but also sustain our energy levels, enabling us to study and work efficiently throughout the day.\nPhysical activities constitute another critical factor, regardless of one's age. In today's world, many people spend extended hours sitting in front of computers, neglecting physical exercise. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to obesity and other health problems, particularly in older age. To optimize the benefits of a clean diet, it is highly advisable to complement it with an appropriate exercise routine. I recommend that individuals dedicate time to engage in simple exercises or visit the gym at least once or twice a week. Regular exercise contributes to a healthier physique, and it's evident that individuals who embrace an active lifestyle tend to enjoy good health and well-toned bodies. Additionally, the importance of a proper rest regimen should not be overlooked. Whether it's a short afternoon nap or personal downtime on the weekend, these moments of rest are remarkably effective in rejuvenating one's energy levels and promoting overall mental well-being.\nIn conclusion, a harmonious blend of a balanced diet, regular exercise, and a well-structured rest routine is undeniably pivotal in achieving a healthier life. While there are numerous approaches to adopt a healthy lifestyle, the key lies in how effectively one combines and manages these aspects of their well-being.\n"

      "question": "To what extent are lenient punishments and lack of skills responsible for recidivism? Discuss how these issues can be addressed.",
      "paragraph": "It is indeed true that some individuals who have committed crimes go on to commit further offenses even after facing punishment. While there are several reasons behind this concerning trend, there are effective measures that governments can take to address this issue.\nTwo primary factors contribute to the recurrence of criminal behavior among some individuals. Firstly, the severity of the punishment they receive may not serve as a sufficient deterrent. For example, in certain countries, the relatively lenient penalties for theft have resulted in a high rate of re-offending among thieves. Secondly, in today's highly competitive job market, working adults require strong qualifications to secure employment. This poses a significant challenge for ex-prisoners, as they often lack the necessary skills or credentials to secure a job, leaving them with limited means to support themselves financially. Consequently, they may resort to committing crimes again as a seemingly easier way to earn money.\nTo address the aforementioned issues, both governments and individuals must take proactive steps. Firstly, governments should enact stringent laws to make offenders fully grasp the negative consequences of their actions. Additionally, rehabilitation plays a vital role in encouraging individuals to acquire essential life skills and better prepare themselves for reintegration into society. For instance, prisons can offer practical training programs in areas such as computer programming, car maintenance, and housing construction. Furthermore, it is crucial for offenders to acknowledge their wrongdoings and be genuinely committed to turning their lives around.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the lack of strict penalties and the absence of essential skills are the primary reasons why some individuals re-offend. Therefore, both authorities and those who have broken the law should take concerted efforts to prevent further criminal activity.\n"

In this essay, I will explore both perspectives and offer my own viewpoint.\nFirst and foremost, some argue that museums can serve as recreational havens for the youth, allowing them to escape the hustle and bustle of urban life. For instance, many young people have a fondness for visiting museums and art galleries to capture photos with the exhibits. This provides them with a welcome respite from the demands of their daily lives. Moreover, the serene environment of museums enables young individuals to fully engage in leisure activities like exploring AI programs or immersing themselves in virtual reality experiences related to history. Consequently, museums not only help alleviate the stress experienced by young people but also pique their interest due to their entertainment value.\nOn the other hand, an increasing number of individuals believe that museums play a crucial role in educating the youth. They argue that museums offer a wealth of information, including local history, science, and technology, which can significantly enhance the knowledge and academic pursuits of young individuals. Additionally, museums provide opportunities for self-improvement and cognitive development. For example, each exhibition conveys a meaningful message from its creators to the audience, promoting increased awareness and knowledge.

      "paragraph": "In today's modern society, numerous chatting applications have emerged, and social media has profoundly altered human communication. In this essay, I will express my opinion about the primary cause of this change and demonstrate that it represents a negative development in people's lives.\nTo commence, one of the primary reasons for the shift from face-to-face communication to online chatting via social media is its sheer convenience. Firstly, social media facilitates quick communication through the use of computers or mobile phones. In the past, people relied on traditional mail services, which were inconvenient and time-consuming compared to sending emails or using online chatting applications. For instance, sending an email via Gmail, Outlook, or Messenger takes only a few seconds, making it much faster than traditional mail. Secondly, with smartphones, people can engage in conversations anytime and anywhere through various social media applications, which is impractical with face-to-face communication or traditional mail. For instance, Messenger has become a widely recognized and popular platform for online chatting.\nFrom my perspective, social media has some detrimental effects on human communication, primarily due to its impact on conversational skills and the growing disconnect between people. Individuals, especially teenagers, tend to engage in extensive social media chats, favoring short messages or acronyms, which are ill-suited for face-to-face conversations. Consequently, they gradually abandon full sentences in real-life interactions. Moreover, excessive use of chatting applications can lead to dependency on computers and mobile phones, which can negatively affect human health and pose various challenges to mental well-being. For example, individuals may develop short-sightedness or become addicted to social media if they excessively engage in online chatting.\nIn conclusion, social media has revolutionized the way people communicate, primarily due to its convenience.

I completely agree with the idea that schools should prioritize academic subjects, leaving the acquisition of practical skills to the family and friends.\nThere are several compelling reasons why schools should emphasize academic subjects. Firstly, examination results play a pivotal role in a student's academic record. Good results significantly enhance a student's chances of gaining admission to prestigious institutions, which offer an ideal environment for their personal development. For instance, students who consistently achieve top grades in high school often secure direct admission to renowned universities such as NEU, a top-tier institution known for its excellence in finance education. Secondly, academic subjects provide students with essential knowledge that forms the foundation for their tertiary education. To illustrate, in Vietnam, undergraduate students are required to pass advanced mathematics, which builds upon the mathematical concepts taught in high school. Without a strong grasp of these fundamentals, students may struggle with their university exams, leading to the need for retakes, which can be both time-consuming and costly.\nConversely, practical skills, such as cooking and laundry, are better suited to being taught by family and friends. These skills are crucial for a student's overall development, particularly for those who live far away from their families. Learning to prepare meals, for instance, enables students to become self-sufficient and avoid relying on takeout food from restaurants.\nIn conclusion, it is essential for students to strike a balance between academic subjects and practical skills. However, the responsibility of schools should primarily revolve around imparting fundamental knowledge, while parents and friends should take on the role of teaching practical life skills.

While I acknowledge the drawbacks of this phenomenon, its advantages unquestionably outweigh the disadvantages.\nIt is evident that consumer goods have impacted individuals' ability to maintain a healthy work-life balance. The proliferation of various types of goods often compels people to work harder in pursuit of a better standard of living. Consequently, they tend to neglect personal self-care and recreational opportunities, which can lead to numerous mental health problems, including depression and insomnia. Additionally, the overproduction of consumer goods poses a significant threat to the environment. For instance, many companies resort to chemical fertilizers to expedite the growth of plants and vegetables. This, in turn, can harm the soil and water sources, posing risks to human health.\nDespite these undeniable disadvantages, the benefits of consumer goods production should not be disregarded. One of the foremost advantages is the promotion of sustainable development within the national economy. This is because organizations must continuously improve the quality of their goods to meet the demands of the market. This continuous improvement ultimately encourages consumers to make more frequent purchases, leading to higher profits. Moreover, the widespread popularity of consumer products has generated numerous career opportunities for individuals, thereby enhancing their living standards. Similarly, increased company prosperity resulting from successful business ventures or collaborations can lead to higher incomes for workers.

The question of whether it is right to confine animals in zoos or if zoos serve as a source of entertainment and ecological importance is a topic of debate. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives and offer my own opinion.\nOn one hand, there are compelling arguments in favor of keeping wild animals in zoos. Firstly, zoos can provide protection and care for animals during adverse weather conditions such as floods, tropical storms, or even pandemics. Additionally, zoos ensure a stable food supply and professional care, often resulting in better living conditions compared to the challenges animals face in the wild. Furthermore, zoos play a critical role in conserving endangered species and preserving their genetic diversity, which can be invaluable for scientific research. For instance, certain zoos in Vietnam have successfully conserved endangered turtle species and safeguarded their genetic resources.\nHowever, there are valid concerns about the ethics and drawbacks of confining animals in zoos. Keeping animals in small enclosures, such as breeding facilities, can severely limit their freedom to roam and exhibit natural behaviors, potentially leading to bone diseases and mental health issues. Confinement in cramped spaces can induce depression among animals, which is detrimental to their overall well-being. Moreover, animals in zoos lose their ability to interact with their natural habitats and communicate with their fellow species. This can result in a shorter lifespan for these animals and financial losses for the zoos due to premature deaths.\nIn my opinion, the issue of keeping animals in zoos is not black and white. While zoos can serve important purposes such as protection from adverse conditions and conservation efforts, it is crucial to address the ethical concerns surrounding animal welfare. Zoos must prioritize the well-being of animals by providing spacious and enriched environments that mimic their natural habitats. Additionally, efforts should be made to educate the public about wildlife conservation and the importance of preserving animals' natural habitats.\nIn conclusion, the debate over the confinement of animals in zoos is multifaceted. While there are clear advantages in terms of protection and conservation, there are also ethical concerns and potential drawbacks to consider. Striking a balance between the welfare of animals and the educational and scientific benefits of zoos is essential to ensure a more ethical and sustainable approach to wildlife preservation.\n"

This essay aims to examine both the advantages and disadvantages of this trend, ultimately concluding that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that starting a new life far from one's home can offer certain advantages. Firstly, individuals may have a greater chance of securing well-paying job opportunities, especially in economically developed countries like Japan or the USA. This can lead to increased job satisfaction and faster career advancement, which are desirable for many employees.

While some argue that advertising plays a pivotal role in driving product sales, others believe that high sales figures are primarily driven by consumer demand. In this essay, I will explore the rationale behind both perspectives.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that a significant number of consumers are influenced to make purchases through digital marketing. To illustrate, advertisements often present captivating visuals and engaging audio effects that pique viewers' curiosity. Consequently, after being immersed in catchy tunes and vibrant images, customers are inclined to buy products, irrespective of their actual needs. A prime example of this is celebrity endorsements; when popular figures endorse a particular product, its sales revenue can soar significantly.\nFurthermore, the exaggeration in promoting newly-launched products is another factor to consider. Specifically, businesses tend to overstate the quality of their products in the hopes of grabbing customers' attention and boosting sales. Consequently, false advertising can lead consumers to invest substantial sums of money in low-quality products that do not meet their actual needs.\nOn the other hand, sales figures rise in accordance with customer demand. Depending on the season and specific times, customers have varying requirements for different types of products.

Some individuals argue that certain information holds immense significance and freely sharing it may lead to loss of benefits and disputes over ownership. Personally, I strongly advocate for the dissemination of knowledge rather than hoarding it. In the ensuing paragraphs, I will explore both perspectives and articulate my own stance.\nOn one hand, when we exchange information, we can expedite progress in scientific research and education. It possesses the potential to benefit people from all walks of life, whether they are affluent or economically disadvantaged, by broadening their knowledge horizons. The fundamental rationale behind this viewpoint is that when a larger number of individuals have access to information, it can lead to constant feedback, thereby enhancing research and commercial solutions. We all face limitations in terms of resources and capacity for meaningful research, but these constraints are mitigated when information exchange is open and inclusive.\nOn the other hand, some organizations opt to safeguard specific details because they perceive it as necessary. They believe that they should reap the rewards of their investments in research within a particular domain. To maintain a competitive edge and prevent potential patent disputes, companies also keep sensitive information concerning their financial status and algorithms confidential. Sharing such critical knowledge might entail substantial financial costs and erode their competitive advantage.\nIn conclusion, the act of sharing knowledge empowers us to develop mature and sustainable solutions.

Views on this matter are divided, with some condemning the confinement of animals, while others endorse zoos for their role in providing entertainment to the public and raising awareness about ecological issues. This essay will explore both perspectives before presenting my own viewpoint.\nMany supporters of zoos argue that they serve a vital purpose in both entertaining the public and contributing to ecological conservation. Zoos offer a unique opportunity for people to observe and learn about animals they might never encounter in their natural habitat. Additionally, zoos often engage in various conservation programs aimed at safeguarding endangered species from extinction. For instance, they provide secure environments for animals whose natural habitats are under threat, allowing them to potentially restore wild populations in the future.\nConversely, critics of zoos argue that confining animals in captivity violates their fundamental rights. In their natural habitats, animals have the freedom to roam, hunt, socialize, and engage in their natural behaviors. When placed in small enclosures within zoos, these animals often lose these essential aspects of their lives. Many animals experience stress and frustration due to the limited space, leading to repetitive behaviors and self-inflicted harm.\nIn conclusion, the ongoing debate regarding the ethics of zoos and their ecological importance presents valid arguments on both sides. However, in my opinion, the focus should be on establishing ethical zoos that prioritize the rights and well-being of animals, emphasizing the value of all living beings.\n"

This phenomenon has led to adverse outcomes, which I will discuss in this essay.\nThere are several compelling factors contributing to the ongoing increase in the world's population. Firstly, societies now have unprecedented access to improved healthcare facilities and resources. Governments are increasingly prioritizing the health and safety of their citizens, leading to the expansion of health centers and advancements in healthcare services. For instance, diseases once considered incurable can now be eradicated with the assistance of skilled healthcare professionals and innovative treatment methods. Secondly, the world is experiencing a period of relative peace. In the past, a significant number of lives were lost in frequent large-scale conflicts.

Some individuals believe that technology has a negative impact on employees. However, this essay will discuss both the advantages and disadvantages of these changes.\nTo begin with, technology is reducing the personal time of many workers. With the availability of tools that enable employees to work remotely, people are constantly under pressure from their jobs. Workers are often expected to complete tasks even when they are on vacation or during the weekend. For instance, employees, especially in the service and customer care industries, often spend a significant portion of their personal time addressing customer requirements as part of their responsibilities. This trend is becoming increasingly common in various professions, thanks to technological support.\nOn the positive side, by making full use of technological tools, workers can improve their job efficiency and save a lot of time through remote work. Thanks to advancements in internet technology and useful applications from various tech companies, employees can complete their tasks without the need to be physically present in the office. This not only reduces the fatigue associated with long commutes but also saves time otherwise spent in traffic. For example, many private enterprises and startups now have policies that allow employees to work remotely as long as they meet their job requirements. Furthermore, this approach helps significantly reduce operational costs, especially during economic downturns.\nIn conclusion, technological advancements have a profound impact on employees, although they also pose challenges in terms of personal time.

While this shift is not without its drawbacks, I am of the opinion that its benefits outweigh the drawbacks.\nOn one hand, there are numerous advantages to altering the family structure that are quite noteworthy. Firstly, there is a shift from extended families, where three or more generations cohabitate under one roof, to nuclear families, where a married couple lives with their children. This change is particularly welcome as it helps prevent conflicts, misunderstandings, and inconveniences. Different people have varying lifestyles, personalities, and schedules, which can lead to issues in extended families. For example, sharing bathrooms can be a hassle in such situations, whereas every family member can comfortably use the household facilities in a nuclear family. Consequently, the transformation in family structure has significantly improved the quality of life and society as a whole.\nOn the other hand, it would be unwise to underestimate the advantages of the evolving roles of family members. Most notably, there has been a significant increase in the financial contributions of women. In the past, men typically served as the primary breadwinners, while women were responsible for child-rearing, cooking, and household chores. However, as family members' roles have evolved, both partners have started participating in the workforce to enhance their financial stability.

I firmly believe that this trend can potentially have more adverse effects on society, primarily due to a decrease in the available workforce and an increase in welfare expenses.\nOne significant issue that can stem from a higher proportion of elderly citizens in a nation is the scarcity of laborers. This occurs because older individuals are prone to health problems that can hinder their effectiveness in the workplace. For instance, elderly individuals with conditions like Alzheimer's may experience memory loss, leading to reduced job performance and productivity, ultimately affecting business revenues. In contrast, younger workers generally enjoy better health and adapt more swiftly to new technologies, making them better suited to meet the current demands of the job market. Consequently, a surge in the elderly population in some countries may result in a labor shortage.\nThe second challenge arising from the increasing number of elderly individuals is the mounting cost of social welfare. Due to the heightened demand for welfare, especially healthcare services, governments may need to invest more in constructing essential infrastructure such as hospitals or retirement homes. Furthermore, public authorities or private organizations may find themselves incurring substantial expenses to support retirement pensions.

      "paragraph": "A considerable amount of literature discussing the inherent value of historic buildings often takes center stage in public discourse. The focal point of recent debates revolves around whether we should dismantle these remnants of the past to make way for contemporary architecture. While some may express skepticism about retaining these structures for safety reasons, I firmly believe that we should celebrate their virtues as a reminder of our historical and cultural heritage, preventing them from fading into obscurity.\nOne compelling argument in favor of preserving these ancient treasures revolves around the traditional and cultural values embedded in their architectural styles. Throughout history, each era has imposed its unique standards for designing magnificent structures and living spaces, dictating the criteria for selecting building materials and incorporating decorative motifs and structural frameworks. Some of these designs still captivate us today with their exquisite beauty. Safeguarding these remnants of bygone eras allows us to appreciate the evolution of our society and its diverse cultural values. For instance, the Thang Long Imperial Citadel in Vietnam stands as a globally renowned historical site, showcasing its distinctive architecture, including a rectangular-shaped fortress, intricately carved stone palaces, and a 5-meter high brick and stone wall designed for military strategic purposes. Such structures serve as a testament to the country's rich history spanning various epochs.\nIt is true that some architects harbor reservations about maintaining these ancient edifices, given that many of them date back several decades or even centuries, and a significant portion may have suffered from considerable wear and tear, with a heightened risk of structural damage or collapse. However, this concern can be mitigated through diligent maintenance and renovation efforts overseen by responsible management teams. Consequently, the potential hazards associated with these buildings can be minimized. Moreover, such restoration projects offer a valuable opportunity to engage the younger generation in preserving their cultural heritage and bridging generational gaps.\nIn conclusion, while some architects may raise concerns about the safety of historic buildings, I believe that these concerns are unwarranted when we consider the potential benefits of restoration work. Instead of demolishing these structures, we should actively work to conserve them, thus preserving our traditional values and cultural heritage for future generations.\n"

      "question": "To what extent is the wage gap between top-level executives and regular employees in large organizations justified?",
      "paragraph": "It is widely believed that as large organizations continue to grow, there is a prevailing disparity in the salaries between the top-level executives and the regular employees. Some argue that this situation is necessary, while others view it as unjust. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and provide my own opinion.\nOn one hand, it is argued that there are valid reasons for leaders of conglomerates to earn significantly higher salaries than ordinary staff members. One such reason is that when directors shoulder an equivalent workload as regular employees, they should be duly rewarded for their contributions. Equity in the workplace demands that those who bear similar responsibilities receive commensurate compensation. An illustrative example of this is when a director's responsibilities might appear minimal, yet their leadership role is crucial. In such cases, directors often receive higher incomes than employees who are engaged in more extensive tasks. Another factor contributing to this wage disparity is that directors primarily oversee and delegate tasks to their subordinates, without necessarily engaging in the hands-on work. This power dynamic can create a fear among workers, who may face penalties or termination if they fail to comply with their director's instructions. For instance, if an employee fails to complete a task assigned by their director, the director, given their influence within the company, can exert pressure or even initiate their dismissal.\nDespite these apparent inequities in the workplace, I firmly believe that the higher salaries of top-ranking employees are justified. This is primarily due to the immense effort that managers invest in building and sustaining large conglomerates. Many directors have ascended to their positions after years of diligent work as ordinary employees, proving their dedication and perseverance. For instance, directors often have long-standing affiliations with their organizations and contribute significantly to their financial success. Therefore, rewarding them with substantial salaries is a fair acknowledgment of their contributions. Additionally, the experience and decisiveness of managers play a pivotal role in their success. In critical moments that could impact the survival of the conglomerate, leaders must rely on their skills and talents to make informed decisions. When these decisions lead to success, it is only fitting that they receive rewards commensurate with their qualifications.\nIn conclusion, while some may argue that the wage gap between managers of large organizations and regular employees is unfair, I contend that it is justified when directors exhibit strong leadership skills and contribute significantly to the company's success. Salary discrepancies should reflect the effort and experience of individuals in their respective roles.\n"

While some argue for their removal due to safety concerns, I firmly believe that we should celebrate the virtues of these old buildings as reminders of our historical and cultural heritage.\nOne compelling argument in favor of preserving these ancient landmarks is the cultural and historical significance embedded in their architectural styles. Each era often imposed its unique standards for designing grand buildings and residences, including criteria for selecting construction materials and decorative elements. Some of these designs still captivate us today with their exquisite beauty. Preserving these architectural treasures allows us to appreciate how far our society has evolved with its diverse cultural values.

      "paragraph": "Consumer goods have undeniably become an integral part of people's lives today. While I acknowledge the drawbacks associated with this phenomenon, I firmly believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\nIt is evident that consumer goods can disrupt the balance between work and personal life. The proliferation of various types of products often compels individuals to work longer hours in pursuit of a better standard of living. Consequently, this increased work commitment can lead to the neglect of self-care and leisure activities, ultimately resulting in mental health issues, such as depression and insomnia. Moreover, the overproduction of consumer goods can have detrimental effects on the environment. For instance, some companies resort to the use of chemical fertilizers to expedite the growth of plants and vegetables. Consequently, these chemicals can harm the soil and water sources, posing risks to human health.\nNotwithstanding these undeniable disadvantages, the benefits of consumer goods production should not be underestimated, with sustainable national economic development being one of the foremost advantages. This is primarily attributed to organizations' continuous efforts to enhance the quality of their products to meet the demands of the masses. Consequently, this encourages consumers to make regular purchases, resulting in higher profits for businesses. Furthermore, the popularity of consumer products has created numerous career opportunities, thereby improving people's living standards. Similarly, as companies prosper through successful collaborations and ventures, workers' incomes can also be substantially increased, which, in turn, contributes to reducing unemployment rates.\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly support the indispensable role of consumer goods in daily life, despite their inherent drawbacks.\n"

Given its widespread presence, some argue that we pay less attention to the products featured in these advertisements. However, others contend that advertising possesses the power to entice us into purchasing the promoted items. In my view, I believe that advertising does indeed influence our buying decisions. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives.\nStarting with the positive aspects of advertising, it's evident that it can effectively persuade individuals to make purchases. When advertisements are featured in reputable media outlets such as official newspapers, television programs, or endorsed by influencers, they capture the attention of many people. Sometimes, these individuals even contemplate buying the products being advertised. Moreover, frequent exposure to advertisements can shape people's awareness and opinions about specific products and brands. As they become more familiar with these brands, they tend to gain popularity and may even secure more sales or establish a solid reputation.\nOn the flip side, a majority of individuals believe that we have become desensitized to advertising. This can be attributed to several reasons, with boredom and irritation topping the list. For instance, when people seek relaxation through music or movies, intrusive advertisements can disrupt their experience, leading to frustration and a negative mood. Furthermore, the repetitive nature of some advertisements can bore viewers due to a lack of creativity. Additionally, in today's world, the limited diversity in advertising approaches can make them less appealing to new customers.\nIn conclusion, while many argue that advertisements have a strong influence on our purchasing decisions, others believe that various factors have diminished their appeal. In my opinion, despite the drawbacks associated with advertisements, we must acknowledge that advertising today can still easily sway us to buy products, perhaps even more so than in the past.\n"

      "paragraph": "One perspective suggests that technology can significantly alter the way people work. This essay aims to explore the advantages and disadvantages of this trend, ultimately concluding that the former outweighs the latter.\nOn the one hand, the rapid advancement of technology has certain drawbacks. Firstly, the substantial expenses associated with automated systems can strain government finances, potentially leading to budget deficits, increased taxes, or reduced social welfare programs. Consequently, ordinary citizens, particularly those with lower incomes, may find it even more challenging to make ends meet. Secondly, excessive reliance on automated machinery and processes can be problematic. For instance, in Japan, many companies employ robotic engineering and technologies for manufacturing instead of human workers, resulting in a rise in unemployment and financial difficulties for individuals who lose their jobs. This, in turn, affects their ability to afford basic necessities like housing, food, and healthcare.\nOn the other hand, there are compelling reasons to believe that technological advancements offer numerous benefits to people. The primary advantage lies in the role of robotics in our communities. This enables individuals to manage a wide range of tasks more efficiently, allowing them to allocate more time for personal activities such as shopping with friends, preparing meals, and spending quality time with their families. Additionally, automation greatly improves the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. For example, many visually impaired individuals invest in robot cleaners and helpers to assist with household chores, while autonomous vehicles provide them with newfound mobility, allowing them to lead more independent lives and boost their self-confidence.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that there are some disadvantages associated with the adoption of new technology, I contend that technological innovations can significantly enhance the lives of people in various ways.\n"

      "paragraph": "Governments worldwide rightfully prioritize the education of younger generations. However, the alarmingly high number of illiterate adults, even in some of the most advanced nations like the US, has ignited public debate regarding whether more financial resources should be allocated to help these individuals acquire reading and writing skills. I firmly support the idea that this is a worthwhile endeavor, benefiting not only the individuals themselves but also the nation as a whole.\nTo begin with, adults who lack basic literacy skills face significant challenges in their personal and professional lives. Literacy programs equip them with the essential knowledge and skills needed to overcome these hurdles. For instance, participants in these courses will no longer feel powerless when they want to read a bedtime story to their children or compose an email to their friends. Similarly, they will no longer be denied opportunities for career advancement solely due to their literacy shortcomings. Therefore, adult education liberates individuals with limited literacy levels, empowering them to succeed in both personal and professional spheres.\nFurthermore, countries that choose to invest more in adult education can also reap economic benefits. A better-educated workforce can serve as a catalyst for economic growth, as observed in countries like Vietnam, where a clear connection exists between the eradication of illiteracy and economic development. Additionally, literate parents tend to be more effective in raising their children, and thus, investing in adult education leads to better-raised children. The ripple effect of this investment includes a sustainable economy and an improved society.\nIn conclusion, providing access to education for illiterate adults is a sensible and economically sound initiative that should be embraced on a broader scale.\n"

      "paragraph": "It is indeed a concerning issue that some criminals tend to continue their criminal activities without remorse after being released from prison. It is essential to identify the causes of this serious problem and formulate effective solutions to ensure a safer society.\nIn reality, there are various factors contributing to the recurrence of criminal behavior post-incarceration. One possible explanation is that the punishments given to criminals may not be sufficiently severe, which fails to make them fully realize the gravity of their crimes. Consequently, they continue to engage in more serious criminal activities without restraint. For instance, in the mid-20th century, the UK witnessed a particularly heinous case where the identity of a teenage murderer was unknown to the public. He received a mere 7-year prison sentence, and while behind bars, he went on to commit several serious crimes before finally receiving a life sentence at the age of 35.\nOn the other hand, there are viable solutions to tackle the issue of persistent reoffending. One effective approach is for the government to increase the severity of sentences for criminal offenses, thereby raising criminals' awareness of the gravity of their actions. Additionally, individuals can contribute to community safety by promptly reporting any criminal activities to the police.\nIn conclusion, addressing the problem of persistent criminal behavior requires significant effort and a sustained commitment.

Let's start with the benefits of online learning.\nFirstly, online classes offer significant time savings when compared to traditional classroom settings. This is mainly due to the elimination of travel time and reduced distractions. As a teacher, you can utilize various multimedia elements such as images, audio, and videos to make the learning content more engaging and vivid. Furthermore, you can efficiently manage students through the school's website, which is designed for ease of use. Another advantage is the flexibility it offers to students. They can choose from a variety of online learning platforms and courses, guided by their teachers or opt for interactive online courses. Moreover, students can tailor their learning pace according to their abilities and access a wealth of knowledge through online libraries. Online classes provide the convenience of learning anytime and anywhere, be it at home, school, or any other location.\nNow, let's explore the disadvantages of online classes.\nFirstly, students may miss out on the opportunity for in-person interaction and information exchange with their peers. To excel in online learning, clear instructional support is essential. Online classes may not be suitable for older students who are less proficient in computer usage. Some institutions that develop teaching websites may struggle to maintain high standards and provide stable audio and video conditions for a large number of students. Additionally, the online environment may not always foster students' initiative and creativity. It can also limit teachers' ability to communicate their passion and enthusiasm to students effectively. Some educators may face challenges in adapting to online tools, leading to increased workload and pressure.

      "paragraph": "Improved Essay:\nTitle: The Importance of Parenting Courses for New Parents\nWhen young couples embark on the journey of parenthood, they often find themselves facing a multitude of worries and uncertainties. Among these concerns, one of the most persistent is whether they are adequately prepared to raise their children. It is widely advocated that newlyweds should consider enrolling in parenting courses to equip themselves with the necessary skills to nurture their children effectively. In my view, I wholeheartedly support this notion.\nAdmittedly, some may argue that attending parenting courses is unnecessary, contending that child-rearing skills can be acquired through the wisdom passed down by older family members, such as parents and grandparents. According to this perspective, our ancestors successfully raised children for generations without formal education or structured courses. Moreover, it is posited that what works for one child may not be effective for another. Therefore, proponents of this viewpoint suggest that parents should intuitively discover the best approach for their own children through observation and trial and error.\nHowever, this line of reasoning is flawed because it fails to account for the fact that many traditional child-rearing practices have been scientifically proven to be harmful. For instance, in Vietnam, it is a common belief that newborns should be shielded from sunlight during their first month to boost their immune systems, when in fact, the opposite is true. This is precisely where parenting courses play a pivotal role. While it is true that parents can access parenting information through books and online resources, the authenticity and credibility of such information are often questionable. In contrast, attending parenting courses provides young parents with the opportunity to learn from genuine childcare experts. These experts offer evidence-based guidance and can dispel misconceptions, ensuring that parents receive accurate and reliable information.\nIn conclusion, newly married couples should consider dedicating time to attend parenting courses as a means to ensure the healthy development of their children. These courses serve as a valuable resource in helping prospective parents avoid unorthodox and potentially harmful practices while minimizing unnecessary risks associated with raising children. By doing so, parents can embark on their journey of parenthood well-prepared and equipped to provide the best possible upbringing for their offspring.\n"

In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and provide my own opinion on the matter.\nThere are compelling reasons why some people argue that students should have the freedom to choose their preferred fields of study at the university. This means that students can feel at ease when they engage with subjects that align with their interests and abilities. Such intrinsic motivation enhances the educational process, leading to more effective learning and improved academic outcomes. Another rationale is that allowing students to select their subjects conserves valuable resources, including time for teaching and learning, as well as reducing costs and efforts, given that these students are naturally inclined toward their chosen disciplines.\nConversely, those who advocate for studying subjects with clear future relevance posit that this approach offers numerous benefits. These vital subjects contribute significantly to a country's strategic development across various domains such as the economy, society, health, and culture, among others. Furthermore, students who acquire specialized skills that are in demand are more likely to secure employment, thereby reducing unemployment rates. Consequently, this contributes to a nation's prosperity and helps mitigate the risk of social problems.\nIt may seem challenging to determine definitively which form of learning is superior. However, both pursuing one's favorite specialization and focusing on subjects with future job prospects have their distinct advantages.

Personally, I hold the view that this trend, despite its potential advantages, may lead to numerous enduring adverse consequences.\nOn one hand, the benefits of sharing personal data online for various tasks are readily apparent. Firstly, online transactions offer users convenience and efficiency, allowing people to access their accounts and make payments from anywhere in the world at any time. Moreover, online shopping provides customers access to a wide array of products and services from across the globe, often at more affordable prices compared to traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Another noteworthy point to consider is that sharing personal information on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter enables internet users to maintain connections with their family and friends. For instance, students studying abroad often use their social accounts to stay in touch with loved ones.\nOn the other hand, I believe that the long-term repercussions of divulging personal information for routine activities are more substantial. This belief stems from the concern that this trend may create fertile ground for identity theft, fraud, and other criminal activities. Given that cybercriminals could steal and exploit personal data for malicious purposes, the potential risks are evident. Additionally, internet users may become targets for abuse and harassment by bullies on social networking platforms. The increasing prevalence of cyberbullying among teenagers is indicative of this problem, and it can serve as a precursor to mental health disorders such as depression, stress, and anxiety within this age group.\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential advantages of sharing one's personal data online to accomplish daily tasks, I am firmly convinced that the disadvantages of this trend outweigh its benefits.\n"

I personally believe that this trend can have more detrimental effects on society due to potential labor shortages and increased welfare costs.\nOne significant issue stemming from a high percentage of elderly individuals in a country is the scarcity of available workers. This is primarily because older people are more likely to face health challenges that can hinder their work effectiveness. For instance, elderly individuals dealing with conditions like Alzheimer's may exhibit lower work performance and productivity, ultimately leading to reduced business revenue. In contrast, younger individuals tend to enjoy better health and adapt more quickly to new advanced technologies, making them better suited for meeting the current demands of the job market. Consequently, an increase in the elderly population in some countries can result in a shortage of labor.\nThe second issue arising from the growth of the elderly population is the escalating cost of social welfare. Due to the heightened demand for welfare services, especially healthcare, governments may need to invest more in building infrastructure such as hospitals or retirement homes. Furthermore, both governmental and private organizations may find themselves allocating substantial resources to cover retirement pensions. Consequently, the rising percentage of elderly individuals can place additional strain on the national budget.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the steadily increasing number of elderly people can bring about more negative effects on society, including labor shortages and increased expenses in the realm of social welfare.\n"

This issue has sparked debate, with some arguing that such income disparities are justified, while others consider them unfair. In my opinion, it is reasonable for executive officers to receive a higher salary than ordinary workers.\nOn one hand, it is undeniably unfair for ordinary employees to receive lower salaries compared to directors, especially when their working hours are the same. This wage gap can be perceived as unjust. Moreover, directors often delegate tasks to employees, which can create a sense of inequity in the workplace. For instance, employees may feel that they do the majority of the work, while directors primarily oversee and make decisions.\nOn the other hand, there are at least two valid reasons why directors receive higher compensation. Firstly, directors bear substantial work-related pressures that employees do not experience. They are responsible for managing the entire company, including its employees and operations, which can be an incredibly demanding role. For example, directors must supervise and coordinate all aspects of the company's operations to ensure its success. Secondly, directors hold significant responsibilities for the company's projects and often engage with external contractors. For instance, they are responsible for developing strategies that drive the company's projects forward, thereby ensuring that employees have meaningful tasks to perform.\nIn conclusion, I believe that it is justifiable for directors of large organizations to receive higher incomes than regular workers.

This has sparked considerable debate about whether private firearm ownership, such as handguns, should be prohibited to lower crime rates and curb aggressive tendencies among residents. I am firmly in favor of implementing such restrictions for several compelling reasons.\nSome may argue that individuals should have the unrestricted right to possess firearms. This argument is based on the belief that owning guns can provide people with a sense of security and the means to defend themselves in potentially perilous situations, like street robberies or late-night home invasions. According to this perspective, individuals can protect themselves without having to wait extended periods for law enforcement to respond. Furthermore, carrying firearms can instill a psychological sense of safety, even if individuals never encounter such threats in their lives. This, proponents argue, can make people feel more secure and self-assured when venturing out at night or walking through deserted areas.\nHowever, this line of reasoning is flawed because unrestricted access to firearms, such as shotguns, can inadvertently encourage more criminal activity and serve personal interests. In other words, criminals may exploit this tool to intimidate and coerce others into complying with their demands or resolving personal disputes through violent means. Consider the tragic assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, where he was fatally shot by a group of individuals due to political conflicts while riding in a motorcade with his wife. Additionally, many bank robberies in Vietnam have been perpetrated by criminals wielding these weapons. Such incidents not only jeopardize people's physical safety but also their mental well-being.\nIn conclusion, in order to reduce crime rates and deter unlawful behavior, it is imperative that private firearm ownership, including handguns, is strictly regulated and, in some cases, prohibited. Such measures are not only aimed at safeguarding individuals' physical safety but also their mental and emotional health.\n"

It grants the ability to work remotely, offering greater flexibility. This means employees are no longer obligated to physically commute to their workplaces each morning, thanks to an array of devices like computers, phones, and iPads. Such tools facilitate seamless communication with colleagues even while working from the comfort of their homes. This boon is especially valuable for individuals residing far from their workplaces, as it allows them to evade the hassles of traffic congestion and inclement weather. Moreover, it opens up opportunities for global employment, as individuals can seek jobs worldwide and collaborate through the Internet.\nConversely, the evolution of technology also presents some drawbacks. When technology becomes sufficiently advanced to perform tasks previously handled by humans, it can lead to job displacement. This, in turn, increases the risk of unemployment for many individuals who may not have prepared for such technological shifts. Additionally, the absence of on-site supervision can lead to a lack of discipline among employees. Without colleagues or superiors physically present to monitor their activities, workers may struggle to maintain focus on their tasks and may become easily distracted. Consequently, this reduced productivity can pose challenges for companies in terms of monitoring employee performance.\nIn conclusion, the development of technology undeniably brings both advantages and disadvantages to the realm of work.

This demographic situation has sparked discussions regarding whether the advantages of having a predominantly youthful population outweigh the disadvantages. This essay will assess both the pros and cons of this situation and conclude that having a significant proportion of young people offers more advantages than disadvantages.\nOne advantage of having a large population of young adults is the potential for economic growth. Young adults are generally more productive and innovative, and they are more likely to start businesses that can contribute to economic prosperity. Additionally, a substantial pool of young workers can help alleviate the financial burden associated with providing healthcare and pensions for an aging population. For example, countries like India and China boast a significant young population, which has substantially contributed to their rapid economic growth in recent years.\nHowever, a high population of young adults can also bring about negative consequences. One of the primary disadvantages is the potential for elevated unemployment rates, particularly if there is insufficient demand for labor. This can result in social unrest and political instability. Moreover, a youthful population may lead to a shortage of experienced workers, thereby creating skill shortages in specific industries, such as healthcare and education.\nDespite the potential disadvantages, I firmly believe that the advantages of having a relatively large number of young adults in a population outweigh the drawbacks. The economic benefits of a youthful population are too significant to ignore, particularly in developing countries striving for rapid economic growth.\nIn conclusion, while having a substantial population of young adults has both advantages and disadvantages, I contend that the benefits surpass the drawbacks.

In this essay, we will explore these views and also consider my personal opinion on the matter.\nOn one hand, the option of studying subjects based on personal interests offers several advantages. Firstly, it allows students to nurture their creativity and follow their passions without the constraints of a predefined curriculum. They are free to choose from a wide array of subjects, ranging from science to art. This autonomy transforms students into their own teachers, fostering a relaxed and motivated learning environment. Moreover, students can hone existing skills and acquire new ones through this approach. The availability of diverse subjects provides ample opportunities for students to develop their abilities and explore their potential to the fullest. Consequently, they gain a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, which helps them make informed choices about their academic pursuits.\nOn the other hand, advocating for a curriculum focused on subjects with future utility also has numerous merits. Firstly, it enhances students' prospects for securing well-paying jobs upon graduation. A practical education that aligns with the demands of the job market ensures greater employability. Additionally, students who concentrate on subjects relevant to society, such as science and technology, can actively contribute to societal advancement.

Allowing students to select optional subjects provides them with a sense of comfort since they can align their choices with their abilities and experience less academic pressure. Consequently, this approach enhances the effectiveness of their learning, ultimately leading to better academic outcomes. Secondly, from the perspective of educators, offering a variety of subjects can reduce the cost and effort required for teaching, as students are more likely to be fully engaged in their chosen fields. Furthermore, avoiding the need for students to retake courses to improve their grades can save both time and resources. Those who excel in their chosen subjects can smoothly pass their final exams, eliminating the need for costly and time-consuming retraining.\nOn the contrary, the argument for students focusing on subjects that hold practical value for the future is also compelling, benefiting both students and potential employers. Numerous studies support the notion that pursuing majors with future relevance, such as those in science and technology, significantly increases post-graduation job prospects and earning potential. Furthermore, if all students were to exclusively pursue their personal interests, certain academic fields might face decline or even extinction due to lack of interest. Many demanding majors require students to exert significant effort to graduate, and the widespread abandonment of these disciplines could result in the disappearance of essential jobs, leading to societal problems.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that students should be given the choice to pursue subjects that genuinely interest them rather than being compelled to study only compulsory ones. This approach benefits both the individual and society as a whole by fostering student engagement and passion while also ensuring that essential academic fields are not neglected.\n"

      "question": "To what extent should firearms be banned in public spaces to reduce violence and crime rates?",
      "paragraph": "In today's world, while ensuring people's safety remains paramount, there is a prevailing belief that firearms, which some individuals regard as essential for self-defense, should be completely prohibited in our daily lives. From my perspective, I wholeheartedly agree with this viewpoint, as it offers numerous advantages, particularly in reducing violence and crime rates, in addition to presenting alternative methods for safeguarding people's lives and well-being. I will elaborate on these points in this essay.\nFirst and foremost, it is undeniable that firearms, when wielded by individuals involved in criminal activities such as thieves, robbers, gang members, or murderers, pose a significant threat to public safety, increasing the risks citizens face when they venture outside their homes. Furthermore, possessing firearms as a means of self-defense can sometimes encourage people to resort to violent solutions when confronted with difficulties. For example, carrying a gun while experiencing intense anger and emotional turmoil can lead to regrettable outcomes. Numerous studies have indicated that individuals are more likely to resolve problems based on their emotions rather than rational thinking.\nApart from the various reasons supporting a ban on carrying firearms in public spaces, there exist viable alternatives to address this issue. Firstly, there should be increased investment in hiring security personnel and implementing effective safety measures. Gaining the trust of the public is often viewed as a more practical and efficient approach to protecting human lives. Secondly, raising public awareness through educational campaigns and providing proper guidance can contribute to resolving this problem.\nIn conclusion, permitting individuals to carry guns when they are out and about poses a significant danger to both individuals and society at large. It is imperative that this practice be completely eradicated from our society, as it is in the best interest of everyone's safety and well-being.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's fast-paced lifestyle, an increasing number of people have a strong inclination to use high-tech devices like computers and mobile phones, which reduces the opportunity for face-to-face communication. From my perspective, I wholeheartedly agree with this viewpoint for the following reasons.\nThere are several reasons why individuals tend to rely heavily on technical gadgets in their daily lives. First and foremost, this behavior can have a detrimental impact on interpersonal skills. Thanks to the convenience offered by these devices, individuals can easily connect with their friends or establish new relationships through advanced applications like Facebook, Zalo, or Twitter. This leads to a widespread belief that real face-to-face conversations are not as essential. For example, research conducted by Central Queensland University suggests that a majority of individuals are inclined to interact with their friends and family members through these advanced technical gadgets rather than attending in-person meetings.\nOn the other hand, it is evident that such trends can also contribute to social isolation among individuals. Many people struggle to build strong relationships with their families or real-life peers as they spend an extensive amount of time engrossed in their technical devices. Consequently, they may become less confident and feel awkward when communicating with others. To illustrate, today's youth often prioritize taking photos, chatting with friends, and neglecting their immediate surroundings. They tend to share their emotions with virtual friends rather than confiding in family members and genuine friends. Therefore, if individuals excessively use mobile phones or computers, they will significantly diminish essential communication skills such as maintaining eye contact and expressing themselves through body language.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that technical gadgets occupy a crucial role in our lives; however, they can have adverse effects on direct face-to-face interactions.\n"

      "paragraph": "In the present era, technological advancements are an integral part of the success of science. It is argued that the primary objective of science should be to enhance the quality of life for people worldwide. From my perspective, I completely agree with this assertion.\nFirst and foremost, it is undeniably true that the dedication of scientists and the field of science itself plays a pivotal role in our world. Without their discoveries, humanity would never have conquered the devastating impact of various diseases in the past. For instance, a century ago, people succumbed to the flu because there was no knowledge regarding its treatment or prevention. However, as science has progressed, it has yielded positive outcomes: scientists have identified the causes of a wide range of illnesses, saving countless lives. Moreover, science serves as the foundation for space exploration, enabling experts and astronauts to expand our knowledge of Earth, the Sun, the Moon, other planets, and notably, weather forecasting. Consequently, I firmly believe that science has a profound impact on people's lives and should indeed prioritize this goal.\nIt is worth noting that science has significantly raised awareness about the environment in which we constantly reside. With the rapid advancement of science, researchers have promptly identified the threat of climate change. The majority of the population lacked essential knowledge about this issue. Thanks to scientists' findings, the study of global temperature fluctuations, their causes, their impact on human life, and methods of prevention have been incorporated into geography textbooks.\nIn conclusion, the advancement of science not only enhances living conditions and boosts a country's economy but also elevates awareness and concern about the environment, our planet, and its associated challenges. Governments should allocate a significant portion of their budgets to support this field, and I wholeheartedly endorse the statement in its entirety.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's world, the incidence of crime in society has reached alarming levels, particularly when it comes to individuals using firearms to inflict harm. This has sparked a widespread debate about whether private ownership of weapons like guns should be prohibited in order to lower crime rates and mitigate aggressive behaviors among the populace. I firmly support the idea that such a prohibition should be put in place, and here are my reasons.\nSome may argue that individuals should have unrestricted access to guns. They base this on the belief that owning a gun guarantees personal safety and the ability to defend oneself in potentially dangerous or life-threatening situations, such as street robberies or home invasions at night. According to this perspective, individuals can protect themselves without having to wait for the police to arrive, providing a sense of security even if they never encounter such situations in real life. This, proponents argue, would make people feel much safer and more confident when going out at night or walking in deserted areas.\nHowever, this argument has its flaws. Allowing the unrestricted use of firearms, like shotguns, may actually contribute to an increase in crime as criminals can take advantage of this for their unlawful activities and personal gain. In other words, criminals could use firearms to intimidate and coerce individuals, or to resolve personal conflicts through violence. Consider the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, when he was shot by a group of individuals using firearms due to political conflicts while he was riding in a motorcade with his wife. Additionally, numerous bank robberies in Vietnam have been committed by criminals armed with such weapons. These actions put people's lives and safety at risk, and this risk can only be reduced by implementing a ban on the private ownership of shotguns and similar firearms.\nIn conclusion, to decrease crime rates and discourage illegal activities, it is imperative that citizens are not allowed to own firearms under any circumstances. Such a prohibition not only safeguards people's physical safety but also promotes their mental well-being.\n"

      "paragraph": "Many people argue that schools should primarily focus on academic subjects and examination preparation, leaving soft skills like cookery and dressmaking to be learned from family and friends. Personally, I wholeheartedly agree with the idea that schools should prioritize teaching academic subjects, while the responsibility for imparting practical skills should lie with family and friends.\nThere are several compelling reasons why schools should emphasize academic subjects. First and foremost, examination results hold significant importance in a student's academic record. Achieving good results enhances a student's chances of gaining admission to prestigious institutions, which offer the best opportunities for personal development. For instance, students who maintain straight A's throughout high school have a better chance of securing a spot at esteemed universities like NEU, renowned for its finance programs. Secondly, academic subjects provide students with essential knowledge that forms the foundation for higher education. To illustrate, in Vietnam, undergraduates are required to pass advanced mathematics, which encompasses mathematical concepts taught in high school. Without a solid grasp of this subject, students are at risk of failing their exams and facing the inconvenience and cost of retaking them.\nConversely, practical skills like cooking and laundry should be acquired through interaction with family and friends. These life skills are crucial for a student's holistic development, particularly for those who live away from their families. Learning to prepare meals, for instance, empowers students to be self-sufficient, enabling them to cook their meals instead of relying on restaurant takeouts. Parents should take the lead in teaching their children these life skills, involving them in household chores. This not only fosters independence in children but also strengthens the parent-child relationship. As children acquire these skills at home, they become more willing to assist their parents with housework and become capable of living independently.\nIn conclusion, it is my firm belief that students should strike a balance between academic subjects and practical skills. Schools should concentrate on imparting fundamental knowledge, while parents and friends should shoulder the responsibility of equipping students with practical life skills. This division of roles ensures that students receive a well-rounded education that prepares them for both academic success and independent living.\n"

      "paragraph": "Many individuals argue that the natural extinction of species like dinosaurs and dodos should not be interfered with. They believe there are no compelling reasons to safeguard these creatures. While this viewpoint holds some validity, I firmly assert that it is our duty to safeguard these endangered animals.\nOn one hand, extinction is an intrinsic part of the evolutionary process. Animals must adapt rapidly to their changing environments, which means those that evolve slowly or struggle to adapt may naturally fade away over geologic time. Moreover, this phenomenon can also occur due to their inability to survive amidst natural competition and predation, and there may be no practical solutions to prevent extinction. For instance, dinosaurs became extinct millions of years ago due to extensive climate changes like volcanic eruptions, driven by Earth's geothermal alterations. This evolutionary process marked the initial step in shaping the habitat that allows humans to thrive today. Consequently, the disappearance of certain species is inevitable as the Earth undergoes rapid and unpredictable transformations.\nOn the other hand, we bear a responsibility for the vanishing of these creatures because wild species contribute significantly to maintaining the ecological balance. The complete disappearance of a species can trigger a domino effect, leading to the mass extinction of other animals and the destruction of natural habitats. To illustrate, gray wolves in the United States neared extinction due to relentless hunting for their fur, resulting in a decline in the beaver population. It took numerous years and considerable effort from local authorities to restore the ecosystem. Additionally, many exotic animals hold cultural significance for their respective countries. In China, pandas are revered as symbols of the nation's biodiversity, exclusively found within its borders. Designated as national treasures and listed in the Red List, pandas receive protection from the government and serve as a means to enhance economic relations with other countries. They also play a crucial role in raising global awareness about conservation. Since animals coexist with humans, it becomes imperative to preserve them to ensure the well-being of both our lives and the ecosystem.\nIn conclusion, mass extinctions are not solely the result of natural processes; human actions also contribute significantly. It is essential for people to recognize the importance of protecting animals and take proactive measures to address their impending disappearance.\n"

This has sparked widespread debate on whether private gun ownership should be prohibited in an effort to decrease both crime rates and aggressive conduct among citizens. I strongly support this notion for several reasons.\nSome may argue that individuals should have the unrestricted right to possess firearms. This argument is based on the belief that owning a firearm ensures personal safety and self-defense in potentially perilous situations, such as street robberies or home invasions late at night. According to this perspective, individuals can protect themselves without having to wait for law enforcement to arrive. Furthermore, carrying firearms provides individuals with a psychological sense of security, even if they never encounter such situations in their lives. This heightened sense of security can make people feel safer and more confident when venturing out at night or walking in deserted areas.\nHowever, this line of reasoning is flawed, as unrestricted access to firearms, like shotguns, can actually lead to an increase in crime. Criminals may exploit this freedom to further their illegal activities and personal agendas. In essence, firearms can be used by criminals to intimidate and coerce individuals or to settle personal disputes in a violent manner. Consider the assassination of President John F.

      "paragraph": "In the era of globalization, having strong language skills has become essential for career advancement, personal development, and building social connections. Some argue that teaching foreign languages to primary school children can help them establish a deeper connection with the global community and excel in higher education. This essay will examine both sides of this issue and provide my own perspective.\nOn the opposing side, one significant challenge with promoting language learning among young children is the availability of suitable resources. In today's fast-paced, technology-driven world, advancements in fields like AI software, robotics, and scientific research demonstrate the progress of human knowledge. Therefore, it is crucial to keep pace with these evolving innovations by prioritizing core subjects like mathematics, physics, and chemistry, rather than placing excessive emphasis on short-term benefits of bilingual abilities. Children should focus on scientific subjects in their early years to nurture a strong passion for science. Vietnam serves as a notable example, where a growing demand for language learning among primary school students, driven by opportunities to study abroad and enroll in top-level schools, has led to an educational culture that neglects core subjects.\nConversely, proponents of teaching foreign languages to primary school students argue that the major advantages lie in the realm of global business. Globalization has interconnected countries like never before, leading to increased GDP, investments, and economic growth across borders. This interconnectedness underscores the importance of foreign language skills, as international cooperation often necessitates citizens who can communicate in multiple languages. Developing a strong foundation in foreign languages during primary education is believed to create numerous job opportunities and facilitate career growth for these students later in life. Additionally, early language learning fosters valuable skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and effective communication.\nIn conclusion, the benefits of introducing foreign language instruction in primary education are diverse, encompassing educational opportunities, personal development, and career prospects. However, we must also consider the potential downsides, such as the risk of detracting from core subjects and fostering ineffective learning approaches. These aspects are not mutually exclusive but can complement each other when approached in a balanced manner. In my opinion, a holistic approach that values both core subjects and language skills is essential for comprehensive personal development and a harmonious society.\n"

      "paragraph": "In many countries, the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. Does this trend have more positive or negative effects on society?\nIn some nations, there is a gradually increasing number of elderly people. I personally believe that this development can have more adverse impacts on society, such as the lack of workforce and the rise in welfare costs.\nOne serious problem that can arise from the high percentage of older people in a country is the scarcity of workers. Most companies tend to avoid hiring older individuals due to concerns about potential health issues like Alzheimer's or stroke. These illnesses can hinder the performance and productivity of older employees, potentially leading to a decline in a company's revenue. In contrast, younger individuals often enjoy better health and adapt more quickly to new advanced technologies, making them better suited to meet current job demands. Consequently, an increase in the elderly population in some countries may result in a shortage of available workers.\nThe second issue resulting from the increase in elderly people is the growing cost of social welfare. Due to the higher demand for welfare services, particularly in healthcare, governments must invest more in infrastructure development, such as hospitals and retirement homes. Additionally, both government authorities and private organizations incur substantial expenses in providing retirement pensions. Consequently, a higher percentage of elderly people can place a greater financial burden on the national budget.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the steadily rising number of elderly people can bring more negative effects on society, including the unavailability of workers and increased costs in social welfare.\n"

In my view, while this practice can offer valuable life experiences to high school graduates, the potential drawbacks it brings to their academic performance are of significantly greater concern.\nIt is undeniably true that those who choose to take a gap year can acquire a wide range of life skills and experiences during this period. Traveling to different destinations and engaging in various occupations allows them to enrich and refine their abilities, particularly when they are exposed to unfamiliar cultures. A noteworthy example of this is the fact that students living abroad are compelled to lead independent lives and learn new languages to adapt swiftly to their surroundings. Despite the belief that this may entail substantial expenses and that jobs available to high school graduates are typically low-paying, the practical skills acquired and the opportunity to broaden their horizons are unquestionably valuable.\nOn the flip side, I am convinced that the aforementioned advantages pale in comparison to the detrimental effects of this practice, particularly on students' academic performance. After a year-long hiatus spent on excursions and in work environments, students often experience a loss of momentum and a decline in motivation. This can result in poor academic performance and, consequently, peer pressure to catch up. To illustrate, high school seniors may begin to view tertiary education as unnecessary and time-consuming, believing that they can earn a living through various job opportunities based on their acquired experience and skills.

I tend to agree with the notion that music can foster a sense of togetherness among people from different countries, but I also believe that it may not be as effective in bridging generational divides.\nOn one hand, individuals residing in different parts of the world often share a common appreciation for music in contemporary times. This phenomenon occurs because composers and lyricists frequently incorporate elements of their respective cultures and ways of life into their music, making it appealing to audiences from foreign lands. Many people are eager to explore music from other countries as it provides them with valuable insights into different customs and traditions. For instance, the songs crafted by RH, a renowned British singer and composer, have gained popularity worldwide, primarily due to their ability to convey the emotions and cultures of the people they represent. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that music can indeed bring people from various countries closer together.\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that music can also contribute to generational gaps. While younger individuals often gravitate towards genres such as pop and rap, older generations tend to favor music with themes centered around motivation and positivity. For example, recent surveys have revealed that Bollywood songs composed in the 20th century continue to be cherished by the elderly population in India, whereas the younger generation expresses a lack of enthusiasm for these tunes. Consequently, it becomes evident that music may not be very effective in fostering unity among people of different age groups.\nIn conclusion, music serves as a valuable medium for connecting individuals from different regions and nations, as it has the capacity to transcend cultural boundaries.

From my perspective, I consider this to be a favorable trend.\nTo commence, commuting via a personal vehicle is typically quicker and more time-efficient. Indeed, if people were to opt for walking or cycling as their means of commuting, they might experience a decline in productivity due to exhaustion, perspiration, and feelings of frustration upon arrival. Conversely, utilizing cars conserves individuals' energy during their journeys to work. This is made possible by the comfort and relaxation provided by vehicles equipped with features such as air conditioning.

I believe that salaries, the working environment, and career advancement opportunities are the key determinants of job satisfaction. However, expectations may vary across different occupations, and I think that job satisfaction remains a distant dream for the majority of employees.\nTo begin with, job satisfaction depends on several factors, such as salaries, the working environment, and development prospects, for example. Firstly, salaries play a predominant role in influencing job satisfaction. In simpler terms, money helps employees meet their basic needs. Additionally, it is considered a symbol of achievement, as higher salaries reflect a higher level of contribution to the organization. Secondly, the working environment also plays a crucial role in influencing job contentment. Employees need a safe and healthy atmosphere that caters to their personal comforts and fosters productivity. Last but not least, the potential for career advancement is another factor contributing to a satisfying career. Employees often view promotion as the ultimate achievement, and when they achieve it, they feel a sense of fulfillment.\nHowever, it is quite challenging for all employees to be completely satisfied with their jobs and workplaces.

An employee who is under pressure to work long hours may not be satisfied with their profession, whereas a more flexible job that aligns with one's passion may offer lower salaries. It seems that human nature presents a formidable challenge for employees seeking satisfaction in their occupations.\nIn conclusion, salaries, a stimulating working environment, and the opportunity for career advancement are major sources of job satisfaction. However, human traits can pose a significant obstacle to achieving job satisfaction for everyone.\"\n"

      "question": "Is it fair to pay managing directors significantly higher salaries than regular workers?",
      "paragraph": "There is indeed a debate about whether it is fair to pay managing directors significantly higher salaries than regular workers. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives.\nOn the one hand, some argue that it is necessary to provide higher salaries to managing directors. While this view is held by some, others believe it is unfair to the regular employees. I will explore both of these viewpoints in my essay below.\nOn the side of those who believe directors deserve higher salaries, it is argued that they play a crucial role in organizations. They are responsible for making important decisions that can significantly impact the company's success. These decisions require a high level of experience, education, and management skills. For example, doctors, who have spent years studying and training, are crucial to society's well-being, and their demanding work requires both concentration and the ability to handle immense pressure. Therefore, it is essential to compensate them accordingly.\nFurthermore, offering substantial salaries to top executives can attract exceptional talent to organizations. When companies are willing to pay well, they can lure individuals with a track record of success. For instance, the Miss Universe Company's decision to pay a substantial amount to CEO Bao Hoang, who had a strong educational background and a history of accomplishments in the business world, helped transform the brand and make it more widely recognized. This demonstrates how high salaries can bring in top-notch professionals.\nOn the other hand, some argue that it is unfair to pay directors significantly more than ordinary workers. Regular employees are the backbone of any organization, contributing significantly to its products and services. Therefore, it is crucial for business owners to invest in their workforce by recognizing and rewarding their contributions. Salary decisions should not be solely based on job titles and location but should also take into account individual talents, responsibilities, and contributions.\nIn conclusion, while ordinary staff members perform essential tasks in an organization, it is essential to recognize that executives often carry the burden of their decisions, which can impact the entire company. This is why they are compensated at a higher rate than ordinary employees. Balancing fair compensation for all employees, regardless of their roles, is a complex issue that requires consideration of various factors.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's modern world, an increasing number of people tend to migrate to urban areas in search of better opportunities. However, there are some significant challenges associated with city life. From my perspective, several practical measures should be adopted to address these issues.\nLiving in urban cities comes with several major drawbacks. Firstly, it is inevitable that the cost of living in cities is much higher than in rural areas. Consequently, city dwellers often struggle to afford expenses related to accommodation, transportation, and even food. Secondly, most cities are seriously affected by pollution, such as micro dust and water contamination. These problems can pose a threat to individuals' health, leading to the risk of severe diseases. It is evident that cities can be both financially straining and detrimental to one's well-being.\nFortunately, these challenging issues can be mitigated through several practical solutions. Governments could enhance the quality of life for all residents by investing more in their basic needs. For instance, citizens should have access to affordable housing options subsidized by governmental funds. Regarding environmental concerns, authorities should take responsibility for promoting various campaigns and workshops to raise social awareness about pollution. Consequently, reducing pollution levels would lead to a greener environment, where people can enjoy a better quality of life.\nIn conclusion, while moving to large metropolises may have some disadvantages, there are numerous measures that can be widely implemented to address the difficulties mentioned above.\n"

      "paragraph": "While many individuals are currently pursuing academic programs, some argue that vocational training should be prioritized due to a shortage of qualified workers, namely electricians and plumbers. I strongly oppose this viewpoint, given that academic learning not only enhances communication skills but also respects each individual's aspirations.\nOne of the primary reasons for my disagreement is that higher education significantly improves communication skills, namely specialized courses in public speaking. To put it simply, some institutions offer specific courses in public communication that concentrate on enhancing speaking skills, body language, and the confidence to deliver effective speeches and presentations. For instance, these courses can equip future plumbers with the ability to explain complex plumbing issues clearly to clients, negotiate fair contracts, and collaborate effectively with other professionals in the field.\nAnother compelling reason for my objection lies in the importance of respecting personal desires when shaping educational paths. Academic learning offers a diverse range of disciplines, enabling individuals to explore their passions and discover the right path for their personal and professional growth. People thrive when they are allowed to follow their own interests and passions. For instance, an individual with a profound passion for history may discover their true calling on their academic journey, ultimately leading to a fulfilling career as a historian.\nIn conclusion, promoting vocational training over academic study is inadvisable, even in the face of a shortage of qualified workers in trades like electricians and plumbers. Academic learning serves as a catalyst for enhancing communication skills, which are vital in all professions. Moreover, it underscores the importance of respecting personal aspirations, allowing individuals to choose educational paths that align with their talents and goals.\n"

While some argue that teaching these skills is unimportant for children, I firmly believe that providing them with agricultural information can bring about numerous advantages.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that instructing elementary students in farming could present some drawbacks. Firstly, learning how to farm may pose certain risks to students. For instance, engaging in practical activities like interacting with animals and trees outdoors can expose students to the potential risk of infectious diseases. Moreover, the use of farming tools can be perilous for them. Additionally, schools in urban areas may face challenges in providing the necessary facilities due to geographical constraints.\nOn the other hand, there are compelling reasons to promote agricultural education and animal husbandry in primary schools. To begin with, it can foster greater social awareness in children, which will prove crucial in their future lives. Immersing themselves in nature can positively influence their attitudes towards the environment and wildlife. Furthermore, these activities can play a significant role in encouraging students to participate in physical exercise. For example, they may have the opportunity to compete with others in farming-related games, which can enhance their physical well-being.

      "paragraph": "In the present era, it has become increasingly common for individuals to opt for owning a house rather than renting one. There are several compelling reasons for this trend, primarily centered around the financial advantages of having a permanent residence and making long-term investments in home ownership. From my perspective, this choice has both positive and negative aspects.\nFirst and foremost, a home is meant to be a personal sanctuary where people can relax and feel comfortable. Hence, the enduring value of a home and the potential for additional income through investment are appealing factors that drive people to acquire their own houses. When purchasing a home, individuals establish their ownership, granting them the autonomy to make decisions without requiring permission. This sense of ownership can be passed down through generations, unlike renting, which typically provides only short-term benefits. Furthermore, the financial aspect of home ownership is crucial. Over time, the value of a house is likely to appreciate, potentially allowing homeowners to profit when they decide to sell. Additionally, homeowners can enjoy tax benefits by deducting mortgage interest and property taxes from their income, resulting in cost savings.\nOn the contrary, not owning a house can alleviate the financial burden. Buying a new home often entails a significant upfront cost, including mortgage payments and loans. Choosing to rent can spare individuals from these immediate financial pressures and concerns about potential house damage due to accidents or natural disasters.\nIn conclusion, the decision to become a homeowner is a substantial financial commitment that should be carefully considered.

I concur with the notion that music can foster connections among people from diverse countries. However, I hold the opinion that it may not significantly bridge the generation gap.\nOn the one hand, individuals residing in various corners of the world have developed a penchant for similar genres of music in recent times. This inclination stems from the fact that composers and lyricists often infuse their music with elements of their own cultures and ways of life, aiming to captivate foreign audiences. Many individuals are inclined to explore music from other countries, as it enables them to gain insights into the customs and traditions of different nations. For instance, the compositions of RH, a renowned British singer and composer, gained global popularity by effectively conveying emotions and cultural nuances. Consequently, I firmly believe that music can foster connections among people from diverse nations.\nHowever, it is evident that music can exacerbate the generation gap, particularly between younger and older individuals. While younger generations tend to favor genres like pop and rap, older individuals often harbor an aversion to these musical styles, instead gravitating towards songs with motivational and uplifting themes. Recent surveys, for example, have revealed that Bollywood songs from the 20th century continue to resonate with the elderly population in India, whereas younger generations exhibit a disinterest in them. Therefore, it is apparent that music may have minimal, if any, impact in bridging the divide between individuals of differing ages.\nIn conclusion, music serves as a potent medium for uniting people from various localities and nations by allowing them to appreciate each other's cultures through shared musical experiences. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that music's influence is less pronounced when it comes to narrowing the generation gap, primarily due to varying musical preferences among different age groups.\n"

Several factors contribute to this trend, and it carries both positive and negative implications.\nFirstly, one significant factor driving this phenomenon is the belief among individuals that their social status is determined by the possessions they own. People tend to accumulate valuable items to showcase their affluence or high social standing. If they can afford expensive products, it becomes a means to demonstrate their prosperity or discerning taste. For instance, many young adults today choose to wear costly attire from well-known brands, often exceeding $1,000 in price, when socializing with friends or going to work. Additionally, effective marketing strategies lure customers into purchasing these products. Take Apple, for instance, which is widely recognized for its phones and technology items. Apple's success can be attributed to their innovative marketing techniques and consistently high product quality. They adapt to changing consumer preferences each year, resulting in substantial profits.\nFrom my perspective, indulging in the purchase of high-end clothing, cars, and other items can have adverse financial consequences for families. If individuals spend their entire budget on acquiring these items, they may find themselves struggling to cover essential living expenses. Furthermore, this pursuit can become an addiction, leading to potentially perilous situations, such as borrowing money from unscrupulous sources or even selling one's home.\nIn conclusion, there are various reasons behind the growing trend of purchasing branded clothes, cars, and other items, and it comes with several drawbacks.

In my opinion, this situation is influenced by various factors, and I firmly believe that the considerable advantages of living in different areas outweigh the drawbacks.\nOn one hand, there are compelling reasons why children accompany their parents to live in different areas because of their parents' transferable employment. Firstly, it provides young people with exposure to cultural diversity. Every place has its own unique culture and customs, and by living in different areas, children have the opportunity to broaden their horizons and expand their social circles by forming relationships with local friends. Additionally, children tend to adapt to new lifestyles in new areas, which can make them more independent and less reliant on their parents. Lastly, frequent moves require children to adjust to new environments and handle unfamiliar situations, fostering valuable life skills. For example, when living abroad, students may need to learn how to prepare their own breakfast and lunch.\nOn the flip side, I am convinced that moving too often can be more detrimental for children. A significant issue is that frequent relocations can negatively affect children's emotional well-being. Young children may struggle to form meaningful and long-lasting relationships because they do not have enough time to make friends, leading to feelings of isolation and depression. It is undeniable that this pattern can disrupt and delay their academic progress as well. Students often need to learn new school curricula due to differences in educational systems between regions, which can be both time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, they may struggle to maintain their grades and academic performance.\nIn conclusion, despite the undeniable advantages of living in different areas due to parents' job transfers, the disadvantages related to mental well-being and educational continuity are still outweighed by the more significant positive aspects.\n"

In this essay, we will explore the problems stemming from this situation and discuss potential solutions to minimize its adverse effects.\nThe primary concern when bicycles and cars share the road is the potential disruption to normal traffic flow. The difference in speed between these two modes of transportation can create issues when a vehicle needs to turn or when a fast-moving car must overtake a slower-moving bicycle. This issue is particularly common in countries without dedicated bike lanes, as seen in Vietnam. Car drivers may become frustrated when encountering a slow-moving bicycle on the road, and this speed difference can increase the risk of accidents involving cyclists. In case of an accident, cyclists are at a higher risk due to the lack of protective equipment such as seat belts and airbags, which cars have. Consequently, addressing the matter of bicycles and cars sharing the same road is of utmost importance.\nFortunately, several solutions exist to tackle this problem. Firstly, authorities should establish separate bike lanes on the road to ensure smooth traffic flow and prevent congestion caused by speed disparities. Secondly, law enforcement officers should enforce strict regulations related to cycling laws, safety requirements, and dispute resolution in case of accidents involving bikes and cars. By enforcing these regulations, both cyclists and car drivers can learn appropriate driving behaviors and safely coexist on the road.\nIn conclusion, the coexistence of bicycles and cars on the same road can present risks and disrupt traffic flow.

      "paragraph": "It is indeed a fact that individuals in industrialized nations are now experiencing longer lifespans compared to earlier times. While there will inevitably be some negative consequences associated with this trend, there are potential solutions to address these challenges.\nAs people's lifespans extend, and the population of certain developed countries continues to grow at a surprising rate, various interconnected problems may arise. The primary issue is the increasing number of individuals reaching retirement age who will become eligible for pensions. Consequently, the proportion of younger, working adults will decrease, leading to reduced tax revenue for the government relative to the population size. In essence, an aging population will place a heavier burden on those still in the workforce. Additionally, the rising number of senior citizens will lead to a greater demand for healthcare services tailored to the elderly. Without access to professional healthcare in facilities like nursing homes, for example, younger adults may have to devote their time to caring for their elderly relatives.\nTo mitigate the challenges posed by an aging society, several measures can be considered by governments. Firstly, a straightforward solution would involve raising the retirement age for working adults, possibly from 65 to 70. This adjustment is justified because individuals in this age group often maintain good health and can continue to contribute productively to the workforce. Implementing such a measure would relieve the government of some financial pressure related to pension funding. Another approach governments can take is to promote immigration to bolster the active labor force and increase tax revenues. Lastly, governments must allocate funds from their national budgets to essential healthcare, housing, and transportation facilities for the growing population of older citizens. Properly executed, this investment can help elderly individuals live independently and rely less on their younger relatives.\nIn conclusion, the challenges posed by an aging population are a pressing issue for most developed nations.

      "paragraph": "The question of whether students should study in groups or study independently is a topic of much debate. Education undeniably holds a significant place in our daily lives, and I concur that it is crucial for young learners to engage in both group and independent study.\nTo begin with, students who choose to study independently tend to develop analytical skills and become more self-aware of their strengths and weaknesses in various subjects. Self-directed learning allows individuals to identify areas where they may struggle and seek solutions independently. For example, a student encountering difficulties with a mathematics homework problem is likely to brainstorm ways to tackle it or explore online resources for guidance. Consequently, students become more self-disciplined and adept at problem-solving.\nOn the other hand, studying in groups offers a different perspective on learning. It fosters teamwork skills and knowledge sharing among students. For instance, a student with a talent for subjects like Chemistry and Physics can provide assistance to a peer who may not excel in these areas. Additionally, group study enables the exchange of knowledge across different subjects, enhancing not only one's understanding of specific topics but also overall academic performance. It opens doors to more extensive learning opportunities.\nIn conclusion, both individual and group study approaches have their merits. While studying in groups enhances teamwork, communication skills, and the sharing of knowledge, independent study nurtures analytical thinking and self-discipline.

Some believe that implementing car-free days is a valuable approach, while others argue that there are more practical alternatives. In this essay, we will explore both sides of the argument before presenting my own perspective.\nOn one hand, proponents of car-free days argue that this strategy is effective in reducing emissions from various modes of transportation. It is undeniable that vehicle emissions, including those from individual cars, significantly contribute to the deterioration of air quality. By implementing car-free days, we can substantially reduce harmful pollutants such as carbon dioxide, which is a byproduct of car fuel combustion, thereby improving the overall air quality. However, it's worth noting that in densely populated countries with underdeveloped public transportation systems, relying solely on public transport during car-free days can lead to traffic congestion, which may also contribute to air pollution.\nOn the other hand, there is a compelling argument in favor of alternative methods. For instance, several European Union countries have successfully implemented a carbon tax on emissions from personal cars. With the current high cost of fossil fuels and the additional burden of emission taxes, individuals are incentivized to shift from private cars to public transportation. The revenue generated from these emission taxes can be invested in improving public transportation systems, further reducing air pollution resulting from traffic congestion.\nIn conclusion, while both viewpoints have their merits, I am inclined to believe that there are numerous comprehensive solutions available to address air pollution.

Personally, while I acknowledge the potential effectiveness of this proposal, I believe that additional efforts are necessary to combat poverty effectively.\nProponents of this viewpoint may argue that six years of free education serve as a foundation for individual progress. This initial phase helps establish a sense of self-worth and lays the groundwork for ambition and a willingness to contribute to society's development. Equipping individuals with reading, writing, and numerical skills is the essential first step towards higher education. Over time, the younger generation gains more opportunities to access advanced knowledge, which can play a pivotal role in a country's growth.\nHowever, becoming a developed nation cannot solely rely on the literacy skills acquired during a six-year educational period. In today's rapidly advancing world, basic knowledge alone is insufficient to keep up with technological advancements. Attaining core competencies demands a barrier to entry in terms of academic qualifications beyond the elementary level. This compels people to enhance their education to at least the secondary or higher levels, consequently enhancing their employability and contributing to economic development. Additionally, aside from education, several other factors directly impact economic prosperity, including healthcare systems, infrastructure development, and welfare programs, which must also be prioritized to address the underlying causes of poverty.\nIn conclusion, while providing primary education is essential to break the cycle of poverty, a comprehensive approach involving multiple strategies is required for long-term and sustainable development.\n"

There are several reasons behind this trend, as well as notable effects on the existing urban population, which we will explore in this essay.\nTo start with, one of the primary causes of this migration is the greater potential for higher-paying careers in urban areas compared to the countryside. Farming is a predominant occupation in rural regions, but it typically offers lower wages. In contrast, cities offer a wide array of employment opportunities with more attractive salaries. This economic incentive often drives individuals, who play a crucial role as breadwinners in their families, to move to urban centers in pursuit of better financial prospects. Additionally, cities generally provide a higher standard of living compared to rural areas. With access to various modes of transportation, urban residents can easily travel to different destinations. Furthermore, they can engage in recreational activities after work or studies, such as going to the cinema or spending time with friends at supermarkets or game centers.\nTurning to the effects of this rural-to-urban migration, one prominent consequence is the significant increase in traffic congestion. As people from various locations converge in metropolitan areas, the volume of vehicles used for commuting becomes immense. This not only affects people's moods negatively but also contributes to air pollution. If governments fail to address this issue effectively, it could lead to severe problems in the future. Additionally, this trend can drive up the cost of living in urban areas. The demand for essential resources like food, water, and housing escalates, while the supply remains limited. Without an increase in prices, this could lead to resource scarcity. For instance, in a city like Hanoi, prices for various goods and services are notably higher than in the countryside due to overpopulation and the need for everyone to use resources judiciously to prevent wastage.\nIn conclusion, there are diverse reasons behind the high levels of migration from rural areas to cities in many countries.

Consequently, I firmly believe that admission to university study programs should be accessible to individuals, irrespective of their academic prowess. My reasons for supporting this viewpoint are as follows.\nFirstly, there are compelling arguments in favor of this statement. In certain countries, a student's eligibility for higher education hinges on their academic performance during their school years. Take, for instance, the case of Steve Jobs, the renowned CEO of Apple, who was a high school dropout. This example illustrates that people often excel in fields they are genuinely passionate about and possess a natural aptitude for.

While this issue is driven by several key factors, I firmly believe that there are practical solutions available to address it.\nOn one hand, there are numerous reasons behind the recent decline in environmental quality. Firstly, emissions from private vehicles like cars and motorbikes release excessive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Consequently, the air becomes contaminated, leading to climate change. This, in turn, intensifies natural disasters such as typhoons, floods, and droughts, making them more frequent and unpredictable, resulting in the loss of lives and property. Moreover, people are suffering from respiratory diseases, including emphysema. Furthermore, due to higher living standards and a growing population, companies are compelled to produce large quantities of low-quality, inexpensive goods to meet the rising demand. Consequently, people use these items for short periods and then discard them into rivers and lakes, causing water pollution.\nOn the other hand, I am confident that there are effective measures that can be implemented to address these issues. Firstly, governments can enact environmental laws to ensure citizens' compliance with regulations aimed at protecting our surroundings. This can include imposing heavy penalties on lawbreakers and implementing substantial taxes on companies that rely on fossil fuels. Additionally, allocating funds for the development of clean energy sources, such as hydropower, wind turbines, and solar panels, can significantly improve the situation. Secondly, companies and factories should invest in advanced waste disposal systems while reducing their carbon footprint and transitioning to eco-friendly energy sources and materials. Furthermore, individuals must take responsibility for their environmental impact. They can adopt eco-friendly lifestyles by refraining from littering, using environmentally friendly products, maximizing recycling efforts, and opting for public transportation instead of personal vehicles.

      "paragraph": "In recent times, there have been ongoing discussions about the path to a successful career. Two prominent opinions have emerged: one suggests that pursuing higher education at universities or colleges is the key, while the other advocates for entering the workforce immediately after high school graduation. In this essay, I will explore both viewpoints regarding the decision to pursue further education or start working right after school.\nStarting with the perspective favoring immediate employment after high school, one of the most common concerns raised is the cost of college tuition. This is perhaps the most widely recognized obstacle preventing people from enrolling in higher education institutions. College tuition fees typically span four years, with an average cost of $26,000 for low to middle-class colleges and potentially soaring to $104,000 for top-tier institutions. Additionally, studying abroad can either reduce or increase expenses, depending on the destination country. Consequently, even if you possess high academic potential and an inclination to excel in school, the financial burden may render such aspirations meaningless. Furthermore, when you do manage to attend college, there is the challenge of self-discipline. With no one to constantly remind you to study, it's easy to become complacent. If you neglect your studies and don't fully engage in your lectures, you risk squandering four precious years of your life. Therefore, opting for immediate employment after high school, particularly if financial conditions are not favorable, can be a sensible choice, as it allows you to contribute to your family's well-being at an early stage in your life.\nOn the optimistic side, if you do have the means to attend college, you will be exposed to opportunities for advanced learning. Through college education and potential international experiences, you can acquire a wide range of life skills and gain valuable problem-solving abilities by facing challenges independently. Most importantly, you will have the opportunity to earn certificates and degrees, which significantly enhance your chances of securing a well-paying job and ensuring a stable livelihood.\nIn conclusion, the decision ultimately rests with you. Do you believe you have the financial resources to pursue higher education and the commitment to responsibly complete four years of study, ultimately securing a job? If not, you can explore practical training and employment options to begin supporting yourself and your family at a young age. Regardless of your choice, never feel ashamed of your decision, even if it leads to a profession that society may overlook. Follow your passion and do what you believe is best for your future, unaffected by others' opinions.\n"

This phenomenon has sparked a significant debate regarding whether these changes in hobbies are merely driven by trends or genuinely reflect individual preferences. In my view, I partly agree with the latter perspective.\nUndoubtedly, many hobbies are fleeting trends, particularly among young children and teenagers who often seek to fit in with their peer groups. They can be heavily influenced by their favorite content creators or motivated by a desire to appear stylish or unconventional. For instance, it's not uncommon to see students taking up guitar lessons to impress a crush or friends, only to abandon their efforts midway due to a lack of genuine interest or sheer laziness, despite having invested in lessons. This trend-driven behavior is not exclusive to the youth; adults can also fall into this pattern at times. Over the past two decades, there has been a succession of fitness trends for adults, from yoga to pilates, with a questionable number of participants maintaining their commitment to these activities in the long run.\nConversely, there are individuals who derive immense satisfaction from pursuing less popular hobbies such as playing chess, practicing bonsai, or fishing, despite facing ridicule or mockery from others who deem these activities \"boring.\" These enthusiasts persist in their chosen pursuits because they genuinely enjoy them. I can personally relate to this as well; my own hobbies, playing games and listening to music, initially gained my attention during a trend that occurred long ago. However, I continue to enjoy them to this day because they resonate with my personal interests.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that many popular hobbies are driven by trends, there are also enduring pursuits that bring individuals genuine fulfillment, akin to the traditional hobbies cherished by many. These enduring hobbies are a testament to the fact that personal preferences can often transcend the ebb and flow of fashionable trends.\n"

      "question": "Do the advantages of relocating for career development outweigh the disadvantages?",
      "paragraph": "In the current era, the predominant focus revolves around personal career development. It is evident that in numerous countries, individuals seeking employment often face the need to relocate, leaving behind their friends and families. Although this practice comes with certain disadvantages, the advantages may outweigh them.\nOn one hand, there can be a modest drawback to relocating to different places. One potential issue is the emotional strain people may endure when living far away from their parents and friends. This can be attributed to the necessity of seeking employment to sustain a decent living, often requiring individuals to distance themselves from their primary support network. This phenomenon is particularly notable in the case of international students studying abroad, leading to feelings of isolation and stress as they adapt to unfamiliar cultures. Consequently, psychological well-being plays a pivotal role in personal development and can help individuals manage negative emotions. A lack of psychological stability could result in a significant imbalance in their lives.\nNonetheless, building a career in diverse locations can offer substantial advantages that overshadow these negative impacts. The most apparent benefit is that residing away from one's hometown can provide a wealth of knowledge and experiences. These experiences are instrumental in helping individuals identify potential career opportunities when they join an organization. This is why an increasing number of young adults are willing to embrace the idea of separating from their close acquaintances. Another noteworthy advantage is that without the constant supervision of parents, young people can fully devote themselves to their work. Living with parents often leads to generational conflicts, which can have a detrimental effect on work performance. Consequently, the younger generation may encounter fewer obstacles related to family interference when pursuing their passions.\nIn conclusion, despite the potential drawbacks of distancing oneself from loved ones for the sake of a career, these disadvantages are outweighed by the beneficial effects brought about by personal and professional growth.\n"

      "question": "To what extent do changing common hobbies and interests over decades better reflect trends and fashions than individuals' preferred activities during their free time?",
      "paragraph": "Humans have been concerned about trends and fashions for centuries, as these two have significant effects on their appearance and are also crucial intangible influences to help them keep pace with the developing world. Due to that, there are several opinions about what can better reflect trends and fashions: the changing common hobbies and interests over decades or the activities individuals engage in during their free time. To a considerable extent, the former impresses me.\nThe popularity factor is the first point I'd like to emphasize. Different individuals have different hobbies, ranging from watching TV to reading a book. However, the more well-known these activities are, the more people show a keen interest in them. Such habits can quickly gain widespread attention and become a unique trend within a few weeks. Take TikTok, for instance. People used to primarily use Facebook or Instagram for communication and connection with others. But since TikTok was created, being a platform for sharing short amusing videos, it has become popular due to its utility. Consequently, installing TikTok became a global trend, and more users turned to the app for entertainment, shifting away from their old habits. Another example is the trend of creating recyclable dresses. This initiative began as a contest in Vietnamese schools with the aim of reusing waste materials such as newspapers, plastic, and straws. This meaningful action quickly spread across the country and became a fashion trend.\nIn contrast, individuals' preferred activities do not provide a precise measure of recent trends and fashions. Many people, especially the elderly, are not accustomed to newly discovered preferences and continue to engage in their old activities. For example, my grandfather is among those who stick to his old favorite pastime: enjoying a cup of tea while reading the newspaper. Such habits do not align with the preferences of the younger generation in the midst of the technological revolution. Since my grandfather's choice does not captivate a wide audience, it cannot be considered a trend.\nIn conclusion, various factors contribute to transforming a simple activity into a trend. Comparing the two statements mentioned above, I believe that popular activities and interests serve as a better reflection of current trends and fashions.\n"

      "paragraph": "A hobby is widely considered as a person's interest, something someone can enjoy doing at their own pace in their own time. But as time passes, hobbies, like most things, slowly change. Some argue that what many people consider \"hobbies\" these days are nothing more than following popular trends without a deep interest in the activities themselves. This is indicated by the frequent switches and changes in hobbies, with little commitment to long-term engagement.\nI agree with this perspective to some extent. The way people keep up with trends has indeed influenced the meaning of what is considered a hobby, especially among the younger generation. A hobby should be something that you enjoy wholeheartedly, to the point where you eagerly continue it whenever you have free time and no other pressing obligations. However, nowadays, people often pick up and drop hobbies quickly, rarely sticking to one activity for an extended period. Sometimes, potentially enjoyable hobbies are abandoned because they demand too much time, making it challenging to keep up with what's currently popular.\nNevertheless, closely following trends does have a positive side. Casual awareness of current trends, checking in every now and then, isn't necessarily a negative thing. In fact, it can expose you to new things and activities that might pique your interest and offer a fresh way to spend your leisure time. Therefore, it's not entirely accurate to claim that trends only lead to the loss of a person's genuine interests and activities they truly enjoy. When approached correctly, trends can even help individuals develop new hobbies. Who's to say that a person's actual interests and the things they genuinely enjoy can't align with what happens to be popular at the moment?\nIn conclusion, it's true that hobbies and interests are influenced by the constantly changing interests of the masses. However, it's not entirely accurate to say that they no longer reflect an individual's long-term interests. Trends can shape our hobbies, but they don't necessarily erase our genuine passions.\n"

      "paragraph": "In contemporary society, research has shown that a significant number of individuals involved in criminal activities come from less-educated backgrounds. Some individuals argue that providing education to prisoners is the most effective approach to lowering crime rates and enhancing their employment prospects upon their release from incarceration. While I agree that it is important to provide proper education to individuals in prison, I would like to argue that there are alternative methods to address this issue.\nOn the one hand, educating prisoners can offer several advantages. Specifically, this education can equip inmates with the essential job skills they need to reintegrate into society successfully. It is likely to improve their employment opportunities and enable them to earn a living without resorting to criminal activities after their release. Additionally, education not only helps individuals with a criminal history secure stable employment but also enhances their soft skills, which are vital for becoming responsible citizens.\nOn the other hand, there are more practical approaches to tackling the crime rate. Firstly, the government should implement stricter regulations for individuals involved in criminal activities. By imposing more extended prison sentences and harsher penalties, potential wrongdoers would be deterred from engaging in criminal behavior. Secondly, educating young people in schools about illegal activities and crime prevention can have a more profound and enduring impact on reducing crime rates.\nIn conclusion, while educating inmates in prison is indeed a valuable method for reducing crime levels, it may not be the ultimate solution. There are more viable approaches, such as imposing severe punishments and providing students with knowledge about criminal behavior, which can contribute significantly to addressing the issue of crime in society.\n"

One particular memory stands out from my time in secondary school. I had a deep passion for mathematics and envisioned pursuing it as my major in the future. Despite being well aware that my abilities and academic skills didn't quite measure up to the competition, I stubbornly disregarded all advice from my relatives and single-mindedly pursued mathematics.\nAs expected, I failed the exam to join the ranks of excellent students. This setback hit me hard. As a child who had always been confident in her abilities and had never experienced failure before, I struggled to accept the harsh reality. I lost faith in myself, became disheartened with studying, and closed the door on other opportunities that came my way.\nHowever, after a year of soul-searching and self-reflection, I mustered the courage to give myself another chance. I began to acknowledge that my limitations didn't stem from incompetence but from the need for personal growth and change. I decided to venture into a completely different subject: literature.

      "paragraph": "Nowadays, international integration is a crucial aspect that many developing countries are focusing on. Therefore, the importance of learning a foreign language is a valuable skill that numerous experts recommend introducing to children at the primary school level. This essay will argue that the advantages of learning foreign languages at a young age do not necessarily outweigh the disadvantages.\nOne compelling reason for this assertion is the early exposure to foreign languages, which offers substantial benefits. Many children are encouraged to explore various linguistic realms, which can lead to a wealth of knowledge and experiences. If we envision our known fields as a circle, the uncharted territory lies in the realm of unanswered theories. Learning a different language can significantly contribute to expanding our knowledge base, enriching our experiences, and more. For example, numerous students who received their education in elementary schools have achieved higher scores in assessments like TOEFL compared to those who studied in middle schools.\nAnother factor to consider is that there can be drawbacks for children when they start learning a foreign language at a young age. Firstly, it may become confusing for students who do not receive support from their parents to practice the language at home. This lack of practical application can lead them to question the relevance of learning the language if it is not being used in their daily lives. Furthermore, some primary schools still employ traditional teaching methods. In other words, teachers may focus on teaching students how to use the language for answering specific questions rather than for practical, everyday needs. Consequently, students may become disheartened about their language studies. For instance, I personally began learning English in primary school, and I started to dislike the language because I found it challenging to answer English questions posed by my teachers.\nIn conclusion, introducing foreign language education at the primary school level offers several advantages as it allows students to make mistakes without fear of criticism. However, if children are not taught using effective methods that align with their willingness to learn, it may lead to a loss of interest in language studies.\n"

      "paragraph": "In the contemporary era, owing to humanity's relentless pursuit of economic prosperity, climate change has been deteriorating at an increasing rate. Nevertheless, there is a perspective that suggests it might be more beneficial for people to coexist with climate changes rather than combating them outright. While this viewpoint holds some validity, I believe it could have significant implications for both individuals and society in the long term.\nThere are numerous reasons why some argue for coexisting with climate change. The expenses allocated to combat climate change are exorbitant. To implement measures aimed at preventing climate change, governments must invest in cutting-edge technologies, experts, and research, which places a significant burden on national budgets. Consequently, budget deficits can limit investments in other pressing areas such as healthcare systems, education, and defense. It's important to note that climate change is a natural phenomenon, and humans are not powerful enough to resist the laws of nature. To illustrate this point, consider Japan, which is prone to frequent and unpredictable tsunamis and earthquakes due to its geographical location. Similarly, coastal countries like Vietnam regularly face hurricanes.\nDespite the arguments in favor of coexisting with climate change, I contend that it is more beneficial for people to take proactive measures to prevent it. Climate change can exacerbate natural disasters like hurricanes or floods, which are becoming increasingly frequent and unpredictable. To elaborate, these natural disasters can result in loss of life, property, failed agriculture leading to famine, and increased rates of social crimes. Moreover, climate change can devastate the natural habitats of animals, causing some species to abandon their natural homes and move to new locations, which makes their survival difficult and pushes them to the brink of extinction.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that it is of paramount importance to take immediate actions, both at the individual and government levels, to combat climate change rather than seeking ways to coexist with it.\n"

      "paragraph": "It is widely acknowledged that smoking poses a serious threat to the physical well-being of individuals, not only for the smokers themselves but also for those in close proximity. Hence, the proposition to prohibit smoking in public places garners my wholehearted agreement.\nThere exist several compelling reasons why authorities opt for the restriction of smoking in public spaces. Firstly, smoking is associated with a range of persistent health issues, including high blood pressure, stroke, and heart attacks. Although these complications may not manifest immediately, frequent exposure to cigarette smoke can undeniably lead to deteriorating health. Secondly, the adverse effects of smoking extend beyond just the smokers; they impact non-smokers as well. This is particularly unfair to vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women, and individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, who may experience weakened health due to constant exposure to smoke. Therefore, implementing a ban serves as a protective measure for the overall health and well-being of all individuals.\nIn my view, the consequences of smoking extend not only to human health but also to the environment. Residual cigarette smoke has the potential to inadvertently trigger fires, putting people and property at risk. Countless instances of fires initiated by a mere spark from smoking materials have been documented in various media platforms. Hence, it is imperative to restrict smoking not only in public places but also within the confines of one's own residence.\nFinally, for those individuals who find it challenging to quit smoking, alternative solutions can be explored to reduce the exposure of others to tobacco smoke. This includes the provision of designated smoking areas or the utilization of nicotine replacement therapy. These measures enable smokers to refrain from using tobacco in public spaces, allowing them to distance themselves from non-smokers.\nIn conclusion, the prohibition of smoking in public places is a highly advisable course of action to safeguard the health and well-being of all individuals.\n"

The question of when to initiate foreign language learning is a matter of debate. In my perspective, it is crucial for children to commence their foreign language education at an early stage rather than waiting until secondary school, and I will outline several reasons to support this viewpoint.\nOn one hand, commencing foreign language learning at a young age offers several advantages to budding linguists. First and foremost, young children exhibit a remarkable ability to memorize newly acquired words and grasp the nuances of pronunciation more effectively than older learners. Numerous studies have indicated that at a tender age, learners possess a heightened capacity for imitation and rapid acquisition of new knowledge. Additionally, they tend to exhibit less shyness or self-consciousness when it comes to speaking the language, resulting in a more native-like pronunciation.\nOn the other hand, opponents may argue that introducing foreign language instruction in primary school could have adverse consequences. To begin with, children already have a demanding curriculum, which includes their native language, science, and art. Consequently, adding a new language to their workload might appear burdensome. Furthermore, some may express concerns that learning a foreign language could potentially interfere with their proficiency in their mother tongue. Nonetheless, it is important to note that learning a foreign language at an early age can be an enjoyable experience, often involving captivating games and activities. Moreover, statistical data indicates that children encounter minimal difficulties when learning a foreign language.\nIn conclusion, the advantages of commencing foreign language instruction at a young age outweigh any potential drawbacks.

Consequently, some individuals harbor negative sentiments about this trend. While it is undeniable that there are advantages to this trend, I firmly believe that its disadvantages outweigh the benefits.\nOn the positive side, it is clear that online shopping offers distinct advantages over traditional in-store purchases. Firstly, shopping online is incredibly convenient and time-saving. With a simple click of the mouse, you can effortlessly locate the desired product at a competitive price after comparing ratings and prices across various websites. Moreover, due to technological advancements, numerous user-friendly shopping applications, such as Shopee, Lazada, or Amazon, have emerged, making transactions a breeze with just an internet connection and digital device.\nHowever, on the flip side, the drawbacks of online shopping are not easily avoidable.

In other words, you cannot try on or assess the quality of the product, often resulting in the purchase of ill-fitting or subpar goods. Furthermore, the return and exchange policies on e-commerce websites can be convoluted, with some platforms not offering any return options at all. Another pressing concern is online fraud.

Some individuals advocate for government funding, while others argue that artists should seek alternative sources of funding. In my perspective, I believe that individuals engaged in artistic endeavors should receive funding from both the government and other sources.\nOn one hand, governments bear a responsibility in promoting local culture through artistic projects. Take the United Kingdom, for example, where art installations grace public spaces, such as streets and city squares. These artistic works represent culture, heritage, and history, not only raising awareness about the city but also serving as landmarks and conversation starters for tourists. Consequently, governments should provide financial support to creative artists to produce such art because without their funding, our cities would be far less appealing.\nOn the other hand, there are valid reasons for creative artists to seek funding from sources other than the government. Firstly, national funds often prioritize essential services like education, healthcare, and infrastructure, which are crucial for a country's development. Consequently, allocating funds for art projects, even in public spaces, may be seen as extravagant in comparison. Additionally, artists, like professionals in other fields, can achieve financial independence by selling their artworks.\nIn conclusion, while there are compelling arguments in favor of creative artists seeking funding from alternative sources, it remains imperative for governments to efficiently utilize their expenditures to support art projects.\n"

      "paragraph": "Education is undeniably a fundamental human right. The question at hand is whether students should gain entry into university programs regardless of their academic abilities. In this essay, we will carefully consider this perspective and draw a reasonable conclusion, drawing upon examples from my personal experiences.\nGovernments worldwide actively support free elementary and secondary education programs, recognizing the critical role of an educated populace in a country's development. Conversely, university admissions predominantly rely on a student's academic competence, which is generally determined by their high school subject choices and corresponding grades. Regrettably, this stringent selection system often denies capable individuals, who have the potential to excel in fields like medicine or engineering, the opportunity to pursue their passions. Take India, for instance, where eligibility for medical school hinges on a single exam rather than a holistic assessment of a student's abilities or aptitude. This exam primarily tests memorization skills, not a student's true potential.\nIn light of the above, it is imperative to consider that students must meet certain minimum requirements to be eligible for university admission. However, it is equally essential to give due weight to aptitude tests and career counseling, placing them on par with academic grades. In addition to the entrance exam, a student's overall performance over the preceding two years should factor into the admission decision-making process.\nIn conclusion, admission to university programs should not be solely contingent on a single day's academic performance. Rather, it should take into account a student's innate aptitude, along with their comprehensive academic history. This balanced approach ensures that deserving individuals are not unfairly excluded from pursuing their chosen fields of study.\n"

While this trend has its advantages, I believe that its disadvantages are more significant.\nOn one hand, there are numerous benefits to online shopping. Firstly, products on online shopping platforms tend to be reasonably priced. To explain further, sellers can offer competitive prices because they can eliminate certain expenses such as physical store rent, staff salaries, and utility bills. This allows consumers to access a wide variety of products at affordable prices, making online shopping an appealing choice for those on a budget. Another significant advantage of online shopping is the convenience and time-saving it offers. With just an internet-connected device, people can browse and purchase products from the comfort of their homes. The ability to shop anytime, anywhere eliminates the need to physically visit multiple stores, saving valuable time and effort. Leading e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Shopee also provide fast delivery services, ensuring that products are promptly delivered to the buyer's doorstep.\nOn the other hand, I believe that its drawbacks are more noticeable. To begin with, the absence of physical interaction with products is a significant issue. Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar stores, online shoppers cannot touch or feel the products before making a purchase. This can lead to a sense of uncertainty and dissatisfaction if the product does not meet their expectations upon delivery. Additionally, there is a risk of receiving counterfeit or low-quality items from untrustworthy sellers, which can leave buyers frustrated and disappointed. Another major concern is the potential for cybercrime and the compromise of personal information. Online shoppers are vulnerable to hackers and fraudulent activities, such as unauthorized access to accounts and theft of sensitive data. This can result in financial losses and serious privacy breaches, eroding trust in online shopping platforms. Furthermore, the reliance on delivery services introduces the possibility of logistical issues, such as delayed or damaged shipments. This can inconvenience buyers and disrupt their shopping experience.\nIn conclusion, while online shopping offers certain advantages, such as affordability and convenience, it is important to recognize that the drawbacks associated with this form of commerce are more profound. Therefore, it is necessary for both consumers and e-commerce platforms to exercise caution, prioritize security measures, and address these concerns in order to foster trust and ensure a positive online shopping environment.\n"

While some argue that punishment is necessary to help them learn this, I respectfully disagree. However, it is important for adults to guide and discipline children in ways that promote their development.\nThere are two compelling reasons for my disagreement with the idea of strict punishment. Firstly, young children are inherently innocent, and their mistakes are often unintentional. For example, if a child scribbles on the walls at school, it would be more beneficial to explain to them the unnecessary costs involved in repairing the damaged wall. Secondly, subjecting children to severe punishments for their mistakes may lead to them becoming introverted and even foster the belief that authority figures can easily oppress the weaker ones. For instance, my nephew, who was scolded harshly at school for his mischievous behavior, later started bullying younger kids in our building.\nNevertheless, parents and teachers should guide children in a manner that helps them understand the consequences of their actions without leaving lasting emotional scars. To achieve this, they can employ methods such as assigning tasks like cleaning the walls, picking up litter, or temporarily withholding privileges and rewards. These measures serve to make the child aware that their actions were incorrect and will not be tolerated if repeated. Furthermore, parents should actively monitor their children's behavior. In my personal experience, both my teachers and parents never resorted to violence but instead employed creative and lighthearted penalties that proved effective in the long run.\nIn conclusion, while I disagree with the necessity of harsh punishment, I believe that a measured approach to discipline is effective for maintaining order and guiding children toward better behavior.

From my perspective, I partially agree with this idea due to the subjective nature of physical education.\nOn the one hand, physical classes do not exceed the scope of knowledge or skills. Instead, students can have opportunities to recharge their batteries, relaxing after hours in theoretical lessons. It is true that students are more interested in outdoor activities than indoor classes. This is clearly expressed through many sports like football, tennis, and volleyball, which can improve teamwork and communication skills as students interact with their partners or teams, especially when they have to focus on their chosen sports.\nOn the other hand, physical education classes can be regarded as a barrier to certain aspects of students' capabilities and may include potential risks. This can start with a lack of personal experience and lead students to engage in excessive physical activities, negatively impacting both their mental and physical health, as well as their academic performance, which can result in unexpected outcomes. Moreover, when it comes to students who lack the ability to exercise or have specific health issues, they might experience boredom or may have to face challenges beyond their capabilities, which can lead to a long-term lack of confidence.\nIn conclusion, while physical education has benefits for both mental and physical well-being, it's important to address potential drawbacks and ensure fairness in its implementation, considering the individual needs and abilities of students.\n"

Firstly, the risk of accidents between cars and bicycles significantly increases compared to situations where separate roads are available. Moreover, in case of an accident, the injuries can be more severe. Due to the larger size and greater speed of cars, collisions with bicycles can result in fatalities, making such accidents much more devastating than those occurring on roads designated solely for bicycles. Secondly, car drivers may encounter inconvenience when sharing the road with cyclists. Bicycles usually travel at a slower pace, causing frustration for car drivers behind them who find it difficult to overtake.\nTo address these issues, two potential solutions come to mind. First and foremost, authorities should enforce strict speed limits of under 50 km/h on roads where both cars and bicycles are allowed. Reducing the maximum speed improves the driver's control over their vehicle and decreases the severity of accidents.

Engaging in excessive buying can lead to the misallocation of funds, diverting money that could have been invested wisely in other crucial areas such as education or meaningful travel experiences. This can hinder personal growth and limit opportunities for self-improvement. Furthermore, the overconsumption of inexpensive consumer goods can have detrimental effects on the environment. The production, transportation, and disposal of these goods contribute to carbon emissions, resource depletion, and waste accumulation, posing significant challenges for environmental sustainability.\nIn conclusion, the inclination toward excessive buying behavior in contemporary society is driven by various factors, including the influence of advertisements and the availability of low-priced goods. While there are some positive effects, such as an improved quality of life and economic growth, it is important to consider the negative implications. Excessive buying can lead to the wasteful use of financial resources, diverting funds from more crucial areas like education and meaningful experiences. Furthermore, it can have adverse effects on the environment, contributing to overconsumption and environmental degradation.\n"

      "paragraph": "Some individuals advocate the view that teaching children to differentiate between right and wrong at a very young age plays a significant role in their development, and they believe that punishment is necessary to help them grasp this distinction. In my opinion, while punishment can have its merits, it is not always the best approach. Therefore, I partially agree with this idea, and I will outline the reasons below.\nTo begin with, understanding both sides of a situation contributes significantly to the development of children's cognitive abilities. This is because it is essential to help students develop critical thinking and special intelligence. For example, according to a Vietnamese article, students who can discern the difference between the upside and downside tend to perform better at school than their peers. Furthermore, learning to distinguish between good and bad situations can lead to well-behaved children. If children receive guidance on this matter, good manners are likely to emerge naturally. Consequently, well-mannered children can make valuable contributions to the development of human civilization.\nOn the other hand, I firmly believe that punishment is not always suitable to achieve these merits. It can have detrimental impacts on children's growth, which can manifest as various mental disorders, such as indecisiveness or lack of confidence. Moreover, it can have a profound effect on their physical health, potentially leading to developmental issues in young children.

      "paragraph": "In today's world, it's quite common to witness both cars and bicycles sharing the same road. However, this coexistence can give rise to certain issues that can be addressed through government intervention and increased awareness among the public.\nWhen car drivers and cyclists share the road, two primary problems can emerge. Firstly, the risk of accidents between cars and bicycles significantly escalates compared to situations where separate roads are available. Moreover, in case of an accident, the severity of injuries can be higher. Due to the sheer size and speed of cars, collisions with bicycles can lead to fatalities, making such accidents far more devastating than those occurring on roads designated solely for bicycles. Secondly, car drivers may experience inconvenience when sharing the road with cyclists. Bicycles typically move at a slower pace, causing frustration for car drivers traveling behind them who find it challenging to overtake.\nTo mitigate these issues, two potential solutions come to mind. First and foremost, authorities should enforce strict speed limits of under 50 km/h on roads where both cars and bicycles are allowed. Lowering the maximum speed enhances the driver's control over their vehicle and reduces the severity of accidents. Secondly, the government should invest in the construction of separate lanes dedicated to these two types of vehicles. This separation will facilitate smoother and faster movement for both cars and bicycles, alleviating the current traffic congestion.\nIn conclusion, the coexistence of cyclists and car drivers on the same road can indeed lead to problems. However, through appropriate changes and enhancements to road infrastructure by government bodies, these issues can be effectively addressed.\n"

In my view, I disagree with this notion and firmly believe that teaching both academic subjects and practical life skills concurrently can significantly contribute to the holistic development of students.\nIt is undeniable that academic subjects play a pivotal role in a student's education. Firstly, these subjects pave the way for higher education, which, in turn, opens doors to career advancements and job security in the future. For instance, professions like professors, engineers, or doctors typically require advanced degrees. Moreover, establishing a strong foundation in core subjects during school years ensures easier access to tertiary academic disciplines. For example, undergraduates may find it less challenging to tackle subjects like mathematics, physics, and chemistry if they have a solid grasp of these fundamentals.\nHowever, despite the myriad benefits of academic knowledge, I believe that imparting essential life skills as part of a general education is equally crucial. To begin with, some students may struggle with formal classroom learning and may opt for vocational training courses. In such cases, incorporating life skills education can help students identify suitable career paths and develop practical competencies. Additionally, mastering fundamental life skills is essential for overall personal development. For instance, cooking skills are invaluable not only for saving money but also for ensuring food safety and health. Furthermore, children from dysfunctional families often lack parental guidance and may not have the opportunity to learn these skills at home.\nIn conclusion, I maintain the perspective that both formal academic education and essential life skills should be integrated into the school curriculum.

      "paragraph": "It is a debatable issue whether parents should focus more on their children's physical development or instill humane values. While I acknowledge the importance of providing a safe and nurturing environment for the younger generation, I argue that parents should strike a balance between nurturing their children's bodies and minds.\nOn one hand, it is evident that a parent's primary responsibility is to cater to their child's basic physical needs. Indeed, young children are incapable of sourcing their own necessities. In the natural world, most animals inherently take care of their offspring until they reach maturity. Physical well-being is undeniably crucial and serves as the foundation for further development in any living being. For example, children who do not receive adequate nutrition and safety are prone to health issues, which can impede their ability to acquire knowledge and develop a sense of ethics. Thus, meeting these basic needs plays a pivotal role in the progress of child-rearing, enabling children to learn and grow effectively.\nOn the other hand, the ability to exercise self-control and uphold moral values distinguishes humans from other species. Personally, I endorse the idea of integrating both physical and mental care into a child's upbringing. As mentioned earlier, physical development is subservient to other aspects. If a child is hungry or exposed to harmful influences, they will lack the energy and mindset required for learning and acquiring life skills. Moreover, the ultimate aim of parenting is to instill good values in children. In other words, the moral aspect cannot be disregarded. For instance, children who are not guided by social and ethical norms may struggle to secure promising career opportunities once they enter the workforce. Likewise, they may face difficulties in school and at work unless they possess discipline and make ethical choices. Children are profoundly influenced by their parents' teaching methods, as parents are their first teachers. Therefore, parents should pay equal attention to fulfilling both the physical and intellectual needs of their children to ensure their holistic development.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that parents are responsible for providing their children with the essentials for physical growth. However, I believe that parents should also make an effort to nurture their children's mental well-being to promote their overall welfare.\n"

In this essay, we will explore the causes of this phenomenon as well as its effects on the current city residents.\nThere are several reasons behind the high migration rates from rural areas to big cities. One of the primary causes is the pursuit of better education and job opportunities. Cities typically have larger budgets allocated for schools, including modern technologies and facilities. For instance, schools in developed areas offer students access to more advanced equipment, which can serve as a source of inspiration and contribute to improved student performance. Additionally, the high demand for employment in expanding cities is a driving factor. Many companies and businesses, requiring a substantial workforce, are primarily located in cities, creating job opportunities that attract individuals from rural areas.\nHowever, the influx of people into cities can have adverse effects on the existing city dwellers in various aspects. Many major cities worldwide are grappling with overwhelming population growth due to migration. This rapid population increase can lead to issues in transportation, sanitation, healthcare, and infrastructure, among others. The unplanned nature of this migration can put the existing city residents at risk, as it may result in an inadequate capacity in hospitals and a lack of infrastructure to maintain public health standards. Nevertheless, rapid urbanization is a double-edged sword; it brings both challenges and opportunities. For instance, it generates more job opportunities and supports overall business growth.

Some individuals argue that children should commence their foreign language learning journey at primary school, while others contend that it should commence at secondary school. In my view, I wholeheartedly endorse the former perspective.\nOn one hand, there exist compelling reasons for this preference. Young children have a remarkable ability to memorize newly acquired vocabulary and master the pronunciation of the foreign language more effectively. More notably, they tend to approach language learning with greater confidence and less self-consciousness. For instance, when a teacher points to a picture and inquires, \"What is this?\" young learners readily attempt to pronounce the words, regardless of whether their pronunciation is entirely accurate.\nOn the other hand, young learners who embark on acquiring a foreign language may encounter challenges due to their busy schedules encompassing various subjects. As learning a foreign language necessitates using a second language alongside their mother tongue, it can occasionally result in interference with their native language. Nevertheless, the process of learning a foreign language can be made enjoyable through captivating games and activities. Young learners can engage in independent study or collaborate with peers to nurture their language skills. Furthermore, they are more likely to participate in interactive games that entail diverse tasks, thereby stimulating their imaginative faculties.\nIn conclusion, initiating the journey of learning a foreign language during childhood offers a multitude of advantages. While some drawbacks may arise due to the demands of a busy academic schedule, the benefits far outweigh any potential disadvantages. Learning a foreign language at a young age not only broadens one's horizons about foreign cultures but also enhances cognitive development. In my perspective, the merits of early foreign language acquisition are indisputable.\n"

Every situation has both positive and negative aspects, so I believe that there are advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.\nWhen it comes to working, there are several reasons why it is beneficial for high school graduates to work before embarking on their university journey. To begin with, they can have opportunities to try jobs related to their future careers. This can help them assess whether they possess the necessary skills and aptitude for university studies. Moreover, individuals who have gained work experience in fields related to their university majors can find employment more easily after graduating, as employers seek well-qualified and competent staff for their organizations. However, it's essential to note that if they find jobs with higher salaries, young people may become distracted and lose motivation to continue their studies.\nRegarding traveling, personally, I believe that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. On the one hand, taking a break and relaxing after years of studying can refresh the mind, allowing students to recharge their batteries. Consequently, they may not feel overwhelmed by the heavy workload of university studies. On the other hand, travel can have a negative impact on students' motivation. Some high school graduates tend to procrastinate their tasks, often due to the enjoyment they find in travel experiences. This can lead to a decrease in ambition and motivation to excel academically.

Conversely, others contend that they should only have the option to study subjects that are likely to be beneficial in the future, particularly those linked to science and technology. While I comprehend the rationale behind supporting the latter perspective, I personally favor the former viewpoint.\nOn one hand, proponents of restricting the range of subjects students can choose have valid reasons. From their standpoint, a limited selection of subjects can enhance a student's focus. Consequently, this could lead to more effective learning and a shorter duration of study. For example, students who exclusively study mandatory subjects are likely to graduate sooner than those who follow their own preferences. Another aspect to consider is that concentrating on a narrower set of subjects is less challenging than covering a wide array of topics. Consequently, this approach is likely to result in improved average scores.\nOn the other hand, I align with those who believe students should have the freedom to study what they are passionate about. One significant reason is that when students genuinely engage in their chosen subjects, they tend to acquire a broader knowledge base compared to those who only focus on specific disciplines. As a consequence, this expanded knowledge can open up more career opportunities for them. Another crucial advantage is their increased adaptability. This stems from their diverse knowledge base, which makes it easier for them to find jobs that align with their interests. For instance, recent graduates with a broad knowledge base can readily adapt to various roles and have better prospects for career advancement.\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the reasons behind advocating for students to study only subjects with future utility, I remain firm in my belief that students should be granted the freedom to select their courses based on their personal interests.\"\n"

This situation, like most, comes with its share of advantages and disadvantages, which I will explore in this essay.\nOne of the foremost advantages of men working outside the home and women tending to their children at home is that it allows for young children to benefit from quality time spent with their mothers. This nurturing environment contributes to their emotional well-being and helps them develop a strong sense of being cared for. For instance, in my own experience, my mother used to take my siblings and me to the beach during our early years and engage in recreational activities with us in the evenings. This significantly contributed to our feelings of happiness and security. Mothers who do not need to juggle a job alongside their caregiving responsibilities often find themselves with more time and energy to dedicate to managing the household and caring for the family, free from the pressures of full-time employment.\nConversely, a notable disadvantage of this arrangement is that mothers may face limited opportunities for career advancement if they remain primarily responsible for child-rearing. In my country, many families find it essential for both parents to contribute to the family income due to the high cost of living. Having two sources of income significantly eases the financial burden of providing for children. It would be ideal if mothers could temporarily step back from work during their children's formative years but then rejoin the workforce when their children become more independent. Furthermore, many women aspire to pursue interests beyond child-rearing, and as their children grow older, they may desire to pursue careers outside the home.\nIn conclusion, while it undoubtedly benefits young children to have the undivided attention and care of a loving mother, there can be drawbacks for the family, primarily related to financial constraints and a mother's desire for career fulfillment. Striking a balance between traditional caregiving roles and economic necessities is a challenge that many families face in today's world.\n"

The purpose of this essay is to examine both the advantages and disadvantages and then elucidate why I hold the belief that computers have a net positive impact.\nOn the one hand, computers enhance educational development in terms of teaching methods and students' progress. First and foremost, computers can support teachers in preparing lectures more effectively with vivid illustrations that engender greater enthusiasm among their students about the lessons. Accordingly, students are able to comprehend the knowledge better and achieve higher marks.

I find myself in agreement with this perspective for several compelling reasons.\nTo commence, vocational training equips students with practical skills directly aligned with their chosen fields of study, greatly enhancing their employability upon qualification. For instance, individuals undergoing electrician training acquire precise competencies and knowledge tailored to their prospective profession, thereby streamlining their entry into the workforce and enabling them to commence earning income promptly. Conversely, university graduates frequently lack job-specific proficiencies upon completing their academic programs, often encountering challenges in securing suitable employment. Additionally, university curricula tend to emphasize theoretical aspects, potentially rendering the acquired knowledge less pertinent to students' future job roles.\nMoreover, vocational training typically entails shorter durations and lower costs compared to university-level education. Vocational courses can often be completed within a year or less, furnishing students with the necessary skills and knowledge to swiftly transition into the labor market. In contrast, university programs often span 3 to 5 years, and they do not consistently equip graduates with job-ready proficiencies. In certain instances, university graduates may need to undergo additional training before they can successfully integrate into the workforce. Furthermore, vocational training is frequently more budget-friendly than university tuition fees and is often subsidized by the government to meet the employment demands of the job market.\nIn conclusion, I am of the opinion that encouraging a greater number of individuals to pursue vocational training is a prudent course of action.

Personally, I partially agree with this viewpoint.\nMany people strongly advocate for the idea that money is the foremost motivation for working, and their stance is justifiable. The key rationale behind this perspective is that money can provide both physical and mental satisfaction. On a physical level, individuals are more likely to enjoy a higher standard of living. They have the opportunity to acquire modern gadgets and technological devices, as well as meet their material needs, such as covering taxes, handling expensive dowries, or paying bills. Additionally, it is beneficial for their mental well-being. In today's materialistic world, income has become one of the yardsticks for measuring a person's value and social status. In other words, people often judge others based on their possessions, which can help mitigate feelings of depression and anxiety. For instance, in some East Asian countries like Korea, China, or Vietnam, a partner's socioeconomic background is almost a prerequisite, making it nearly impossible for a person with a low income and an entry-level job to find a partner. This underscores the significance of money in our lives.\nNevertheless, there are individuals who work primarily out of passion and curiosity. They dedicate their lives to pursuing intellectual challenges that can lead to a stable job, life experiences, valuable skills, or a conducive work environment. However, the ultimate goal for many of them is still to meet their basic needs and address financial concerns. Those who disregard income as a motivator are in the minority.

      "paragraph": "Nowadays, everyone can encounter advertisements while watching TV series or simply browsing the internet. Some individuals argue that these commercials are highly effective in influencing us to make purchases, while others contend that advertising has become so commonplace that we no longer pay much attention to it. In this essay, I will thoroughly examine this issue and express my own perspective.\nOn one hand, it is indeed true that an increasing number of people spend their money on products they encounter through advertisements. To begin with, most commercials feature captivating storylines akin to short films, showcasing beautiful and compelling images of the promoted items while exaggerating their functions and benefits. Undeniably, these characteristics capture the audience's interest and motivate them to consider buying the products. Additionally, strategically placing commercials within the content people are watching contributes to their success, as viewers must watch these advertisements before continuing with their content.\nOn the other hand, advertising has become less distinct and remarkable, leading to reduced attention from the audience. Firstly, some commercials mimic the content of other advertisements, resulting in new advertisement videos lacking the ability to pique viewers' curiosity or hold their attention. Furthermore, the repetition of commercial breaks has reached a point where people consider it a waste of time to watch them, prompting them to engage in other tasks while the advertisements are airing.\nConsidering all these factors, I conclude that advertising does indeed succeed in prompting us to spend money on advertised products, thanks to the engaging storylines in commercial videos and effective placement strategies. However, it is essential for advertisers to create more innovative and compelling campaigns to sustain this level of success. Personally, I believe that advertising continues to be effective in persuading us to make purchases, but producers must continually strive to develop more impactful campaigns.\n"

      "question": "What are the causes of antisocial behavior and how can we address them?",
      "paragraph": "In recent times, it is widely asserted that there has been a noticeable increase in antisocial behavior and a decline in respect for others. This essay will explore the primary factors contributing to these behaviors and propose potential solutions. Two main reasons account for the surge in antisocial conduct and the lack of respect. Firstly, society's neglect of individuals experiencing mental health issues plays a pivotal role. These individuals require significant attention and emotional support from others to overcome their negative self-perceptions. If they are left to grapple with their distressing emotions and hostile thought patterns over an extended period of time, they may eventually develop antisocial tendencies and disdain for their surroundings, which can have detrimental consequences for society.\nAnother factor contributing to this issue is the proliferation of violent content on video games and social media platforms. It is worth noting that young people are particularly susceptible to the influence of such content due to their impressionable minds. The more exposure they have to brutal content, the more likely they are to react aggressively to society when they disagree with individuals or certain issues.\nNevertheless, several measures can be implemented to address this problem. One possible solution is for the public to engage with non-profit organizations that offer support to individuals experiencing mental health challenges. By doing so, these individuals can establish connections within society and express their thoughts to others, which is widely regarded as one of the most effective ways to alleviate mental health issues and encourage positive behavior.\nAnother viable measure is for the government to exercise control over violent content on the internet. As previously mentioned, such content can significantly influence behavior. Therefore, restricting or regulating such aggressive content while promoting content that fosters a sense of societal responsibility can help reduce the inclination towards antisocial behavior and promote respect for others.\nIn conclusion, there are two primary factors contributing to antisocial behavior and a shortage of respect for others, but there are also several steps that can be taken to address this issue.\n"

      "paragraph": "The substantial reliance on animals in the production of food, medical treatments, and clothing has sparked ongoing debates regarding the need for animal-based products in today's world. I partially agree with those who argue that it is time for humanity to reduce its dependence on animal-derived goods.\nOne reason for my agreement with the consumption of meat as part of our daily diet is that a meatless diet may lack essential nutrients and healthy fatty acids crucial for human physical development. Therefore, maintaining a balanced diet that includes a small portion of meat can provide the necessary energy for extended periods of activity and reduce the risk of health issues like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Additionally, it is widely acknowledged that animals play an indispensable role in the pharmaceutical industry, contributing to life-saving medications and treatments. Some medicines contain important animal byproducts, such as skin, bone, or tissue, which are vital for both human and animal healthcare.\nHowever, despite the valid reasons mentioned above, I still believe that there is no imperative need to utilize animal-derived products. Firstly, due to technological advancements, we can now create artificial and synthetic fibers like nylon, cotton, or polyester, which can replace animal fur and leather in the textile industry. This not only promotes environmental sustainability but also allows consumers to purchase affordable and durable clothing. Another noteworthy point is the moral concern associated with using animals for medical testing solely for human benefit. Animals and humans have distinct biological characteristics, so drugs that pass animal experiments may have adverse effects during human clinical trials. Furthermore, the emergence of computer-simulated modeling and plant-based herbal medicines offers alternative testing methods that are humane, eliminating the need for animals in laboratories.\nIn conclusion, while I believe that the exploitation of animals is no longer an absolute necessity, I am convinced that animals still hold a crucial role in certain sectors.\n"

      "paragraph": "The pollution of the natural environment poses a significant challenge for many developing countries, impacting various aspects of society and the economy. This essay will analyze the primary factors contributing to this issue and propose potential solutions.\nOne major factor behind this problem is extensive deforestation. Numerous forests are cleared to make way for industrial factories, which produce various consumer goods. This, in turn, results in excessive waste generation by individuals, including items like plastic bags and straws. Moreover, the manufacturing processes release harmful chemicals, such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid, into the environment, leading to the formation of acid rain. Worldwide, laboratories produce detrimental chemicals that are emitted into the atmosphere through exhaust pipes. Additionally, improper disposal of these chemicals into rivers further contaminates water and disrupts natural ecosystems, endangering various species. Consequently, our planet is gradually turning into an enormous landfill, endangering the habitats of countless creatures.\nSeveral recommendations can help address this issue. Firstly, consumers can reduce their use of plastic bags by opting for paper bags, thereby minimizing the environmental impact of nylon waste. This small change can make a significant difference in protecting wildlife. Secondly, industries should focus on maintaining proper sewage systems and recycling waste materials. By adopting greener practices, factories can contribute to a cleaner environment. Lastly, promoting environmental awareness and engaging in activities that foster environmental protection can play a pivotal role in mitigating the adverse effects of consumer goods production.\nIn conclusion, the surge in consumer goods production has a detrimental impact on the environment, primarily due to deforestation and the release of harmful chemicals. To combat this problem effectively, governments and individuals must collaborate to adopt eco-friendly materials, prevent waste from entering water bodies, and actively participate in environmental initiatives.\n"

      "paragraph": "There is a growing trend of people purchasing items and products associated with well-known brands. In my view, this development has both positive and negative aspects, and I will elaborate on the reasons behind it.\nTechnology plays a significant role in driving this trend. Firstly, innovation in technology enables brands to reach a wider audience more easily. Many companies are now focusing on their websites and social media to boost their sales and revenue. Additionally, technological advancements have made advertising more creative and effective, allowing brands to educate consumers about their products, leaving a lasting impression in their minds. This, in turn, leads consumers to prioritize these well-known brands when making purchasing decisions.\nIn my opinion, this trend has certain drawbacks. Firstly, renowned brands often leverage their reputation to increase prices and encourage customers to buy more of their products. This can lead consumers into debt or create economic hardships. Furthermore, some argue that this trend is unsustainable, particularly in the fashion industry, which is closely associated with fast fashion. In pursuit of lower costs, these brands may compromise environmental standards, leading to negative consequences for our planet. This concern may extend to other industries that prioritize cost-cutting at the expense of the environment.\nIn conclusion, technology is a driving force behind changing consumer behavior, with both positive and negative consequences. While it allows brands to connect with consumers more effectively, it also raises concerns about affordability and sustainability. It is crucial for people to be aware of the environmental and economic implications associated with this trend.\n"

      "paragraph": "Many students are required to attend specific classes when they reach the age of 15, while others are obliged to study a wide range of subjects until they finish their schooling. Although an education system offering a broad spectrum of subjects can provide diverse knowledge, one with a narrower focus is preferable because it allows students more time for other desired activities.\nSupporters of the comprehensive education system argue that students gain access to a wider range of knowledge that may prove valuable later in life. By attending numerous classes, students are exposed to lessons in various fields, many of which can be highly beneficial as they mature. For example, in Vietnam, students aiming to pursue engineering courses in university only need to excel in Maths and Physics. However, the knowledge acquired in non-major subjects like English or Computer Science can provide them with a competitive advantage when applying for jobs in multinational companies, compared to those who lack proficiency in foreign languages or computer skills.\nConversely, students who focus on only a few subjects have more time for purposes other than studying a multitude of subjects. With fewer subjects to learn, they have extra time for activities such as sports, relaxation, or further research in their chosen areas of study. Engaging in sports helps students alleviate the stress associated with school and reenergize themselves, while conducting additional research serves as a valuable way to reinforce the lessons learned in class. Scientifically, these activities enhance study efficiency and academic performance, making an education system that emphasizes fewer subjects superior to one that compels students to study a wide array of topics.\nIn conclusion, although the knowledge acquired through various classes can be potentially beneficial, I believe that an education program with fewer subjects is more advantageous for students. It grants them the precious gift of time, allowing for deeper study or relaxation, both of which are essential for their overall development and success.\n"

      "paragraph": "Nowadays, an increasing number of individuals aspire to acquire clothing, automobiles, and various items from renowned brands. This inclination can be attributed to the desire to enhance one's appearance, social standing, and self-esteem in order to make a favorable impression on others. In my view, this trend has significant ramifications for our world.\nSociety places great emphasis on materialism, prompting individuals to strive for the highest possible standard of living. Possessing products from famous brands signifies a high standard of living and contributes to earning respect and admiration, thereby bolstering one's image. Moreover, despite the steep price tags associated with renowned trademarks, they offer greater reliability and guarantee superior quality. Their reputation and commitment to safety far surpass that of lesser-known brands.\nFrom my perspective, the growing inclination of individuals to purchase products from well-known brands has several adverse effects on society. Firstly, it results in a considerable amount of money being squandered. People do not necessarily require branded items to perform effectively for their intended purposes. For instance, purchasing a pair of shoes from a small, lesser-known business may still yield excellent performance even after years of use. Furthermore, this trend could be particularly detrimental to many citizens. Individuals with average incomes and those in disadvantaged financial positions may feel compelled to keep up with this trend, potentially pushing them into financial turmoil. If products from renowned brands gain further popularity, it could have a detrimental impact on small brand owners, as they may struggle to sell their products.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the increasing desire among individuals to acquire items from well-known brands is driven by the sense of assurance and improved image they offer. However, I also believe that this trend could have significant societal consequences.\n"

      "paragraph": "It is widely acknowledged that childhood obesity is a contemporary concern. Many people argue that the government should take the main responsibility; however, I partly agree with this statement.\nOn the one hand, governments possess the authority to implement measures that promote healthy lifestyles. The government can establish guidelines mandating schools to offer more nourishing meals. Additionally, they can regulate the advertising of unhealthy food products by reducing children's exposure to persuasive campaigns that often encourage detrimental dietary practices. For example, in the United Kingdom, the government implemented a \"Sugar Tax\" on sugary beverages to reduce consumption among young people, successfully encouraging healthier alternatives among children. Through these measures, governments demonstrate their significant influence in creating an environment that not only educates children about the importance of health but also encourages healthier choices and behaviors as integral parts of their daily lives.\nOn the other hand, placing the entire burden on governments to address this concern is inadequate. Parents and families also play a pivotal role in influencing children's dietary preferences and routines. It is within their purview to impart knowledge about proper nutrition. They can involve their children in the process of preparing balanced meals and actively engage them in physical activities, all of which impact the development of healthy habits and prevent childhood obesity. Studies have shown that children are more likely to adopt a healthy lifestyle if their parents set a positive example since parents have direct control over what their children eat at home and which sports they engage in together. This highlights the need for a balanced approach that involves both government intervention and parental responsibility.\nWhile government intervention is essential, it is not without limitations. Excessive government control over individuals' dietary choices may raise concerns about personal freedom and individual autonomy. For example, critics of school lunch regulations argue that they can be overly restrictive, limiting children's food choices and potentially stigmatizing those who bring their own food.\nChildhood obesity is a complex issue with multiple factors at play. It is crucial to strike a balance between government authorities and families in ensuring well-rounded and wholesome diets for children and effectively addressing this challenge.\n"

      "paragraph": "There is an increasingly popular notion that individuals should have the freedom to continue working even as they enter their senior years. However, there is a prevalent argument suggesting that elderly individuals should retire and refrain from participating in any employment. I am inclined to agree with the latter perspective, asserting that elderly people should be able to choose their path. This essay will explore the key reasons supporting this viewpoint.\nFirst and foremost, older individuals can discover happiness and avoid feelings of isolation by remaining active in the workforce or engaging in part-time employment. For instance, my grandfather is currently employed at a woodworking factory, while many of his peers are unemployed. He has expressed that without this job, he might have become bored and devoid of companionship. Furthermore, his participation in the workforce has enabled him to build connections with his colleagues and neighbors.\nIt is also important to acknowledge that the aging process affects not only physical but also mental health. Consequently, an individual's capabilities become limited as they grow older. For example, a 70-year-old civil engineer continues to work for a construction company, albeit on a part-time basis. Regrettably, he can only participate part-time because he cannot endure lengthy meetings and site visits. Additionally, the tasks assigned to him are restricted due to concerns about potential fatigue.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that elderly individuals should have the choice to engage in work if they wish, as it can help them cultivate friendships and maintain social interactions within their field of expertise, while taking into account their physical health limitations.\n"

From my perspective, owning a home has both advantages and disadvantages.\nIt is undeniable that most individuals nowadays prefer homeownership over renting. Firstly, the location of their residence remains constant. Owning a house leads to more stable living conditions, reducing the likelihood of disruptions caused by frequent moves. The sense of permanence that homeownership provides can contribute to long-term career growth and stability. Moreover, the hassle of constantly relocating furniture can accumulate. Frequent moves can result in significant financial strain, with individuals allocating a substantial portion of their income to moving and transportation expenses. Homeownership alleviates this burden by offering a stable living environment.\nOn a positive note, homeowners can save a considerable amount of money. Paying rent is not a stressful concern because homeowners do not have to allocate funds for their housing every month. Nevertheless, residents living in their own homes are not subject to the rules that renting entails, such as curfews or noise restrictions. For this reason, some residents may feel uncomfortable. On the other hand, renting a home is the best option for young people who cannot afford to purchase a house, particularly students with limited financial resources. Additionally, they often choose to rent a home close to their school for added convenience.\nIn conclusion, there are compelling reasons why owning a house is essential for many people.

This phenomenon is primarily driven by economic factors and educational opportunities, and it will have substantial consequences for the urban population.\nThe migration from the countryside to urban areas can be attributed to economic factors and the availability of education. The primary cause of this trend is the relatively underdeveloped economy in rural regions, which leads to various related issues, including poverty and famine. This economic disparity serves as a motivation for many individuals living in rural areas to relocate to metropolitan areas where the economy is more robust and promising. Furthermore, rural areas often lack adequate working and learning environments. In contrast, urban areas not only offer excellent facilities and infrastructure but also provide greater access to higher education institutions such as colleges compared to rural regions.\nFrom my perspective, the high levels of migration can have several adverse effects on the existing city dwellers. Firstly, such a trend could exacerbate environmental problems in cities. Most metropolises already face severe pollution issues, and an increase in population will only worsen the situation. The growing population results in higher demands for transportation and goods, leading to increased emissions from vehicles and factories. Moreover, cities may struggle to keep up with the surge in population. If a large number of people migrate from rural areas, urban centers may struggle to provide sufficient job opportunities, services, and housing for them.\nIn conclusion, the migration from rural to urban areas is primarily driven by economic and educational factors.

I align with the latter perspective.\nOn one hand, there are valid concerns about the negative aspects of television viewing for children. Firstly, it is argued that excessive TV watching can hinder a child's ability to communicate effectively. In today's digital age, many children opt for television entertainment at home rather than engaging in outdoor activities with friends. Consequently, some children may struggle to establish social connections, potentially affecting their future interpersonal skills. Secondly, certain television programs contain violent or inappropriate content of a sexual nature, which is unsuitable for young viewers. Prolonged exposure to such material may place children at risk of developing aggressive behavior, impacting their overall personality development.\nOn the other hand, I firmly believe that television can have a positive influence on a child's growth and development. Some TV programs offer valuable educational content, ranging from informative documentaries to shows that explore the mysteries of the universe. These programs have the potential to broaden children's horizons, exposing them to knowledge beyond what they typically encounter in school. For example, in Vietnam, there is an educational program called \"The Road to Olympia,\" which imparts a wealth of information to children, enriching their understanding of the world. Additionally, watching TV can provide children with much-needed relaxation after long hours of studying.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that television can exert both positive and negative effects on a child's development.

While there may be certain advantages associated with this trend, I believe that the disadvantages outweigh the benefits due to the potential loss of national revenue and the resulting unemployment crisis.\nOn the positive side, large multinational companies can contribute to an improved standard of living in the host country. Firstly, they offer a wide range of products and services to local residents at competitive prices. This is because, when these multinational giants establish themselves in a particular country, there is no need for the host nation to import goods, which in turn reduces international shipping costs. Secondly, these corporations often invest in the enhancement of local public infrastructure, as they require extensive facilities to operate effectively. Consequently, the local areas witness improvements in their infrastructure.\nOn the flip side, I firmly believe that the disadvantages of this phenomenon outweigh the advantages outlined above. Firstly, the replacement of small businesses by large multinational companies can lead to a decline in national revenue. While these multinational corporations pay taxes, their profits don't stay within the host country. Another compelling reason for my perspective is the potential unemployment crisis that could ensue. In particular, the closure of small businesses results in a significant number of job losses, affecting not only the workers themselves but also their families and society as a whole. Additionally, this trend contributes to a reduction in the diversity of locally produced goods, thereby limiting the variety of national products and services.\nIn conclusion, although the presence of multinational corporations brings some positive effects to the host country, the disappearance of small businesses has more negative consequences than positive ones.

This essay will address the primary issues associated with this phenomenon and suggest some practical solutions.\nOn one hand, there are certain problems linked to the rising life expectancy. One of the most significant challenges is the excessively high cost of providing healthcare services for retirees. It is undeniable that as people live longer, a greater number of elderly individuals experience physical and mental health issues, leading them to rely heavily on government-funded pensions, which are meant to cover medical expenses. Consequently, governments are compelled to reduce expenditures in critical areas, thereby negatively impacting the sustainable development of their countries. Another concern is the reduced productivity of the workforce. It is indisputable that older individuals often struggle to maintain high levels of productivity in both physical and intellectual tasks, potentially limiting job opportunities for younger people.\nGiven that this phenomenon can result in substantial and far-reaching problems, both governments and individuals should take immediate action to address the aforementioned issues. One effective remedy is to promote the importance of a healthy lifestyle among the elderly. Without a doubt, if older individuals better understand how to maintain their health, they can reduce the occurrence of preventable diseases. This, in turn, would lower the demand for state pensions and subsequently decrease government spending on public healthcare services. Another viable approach is to invest in high-technology and labor-saving solutions in the workforce.\nIn conclusion, while the increasing average life expectancy can lead to national development, it also has the potential to reduce workforce productivity.

This trend can be attributed to several factors, and I view it as a negative development.\nThere are two primary reasons for the growing tendency of individuals to talk about their income or material possessions. Firstly, these topics have become more suitable for casual conversations due to their relevance in daily life. Given that financial matters are an integral part of modern living, people may naturally feel inclined to discuss them, whether it's sharing their monthly salary or discussing recent purchases. Secondly, affluent individuals often showcase their financial success when interacting with acquaintances, family, and friends. They do so by highlighting significant purchases or successful business ventures. For instance, by mentioning a salary increase, a profitable investment, or a lavish expenditure, individuals can implicitly convey their financial achievements and leave an impression on others with their success stories.\nHowever, there are compelling reasons to suggest that this trend has various drawbacks. Foremost among these is the potential for fostering competition and comparisons regarding financial acquisition among individuals. Consequently, many people who face financial challenges may experience self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy as they find themselves unable to keep up with others. This, in turn, can have adverse effects on their mental health and overall well-being.

Although one can argue that criminal behavior is linked to an individual's innate tendencies, my inclination is towards the role of social problems and poverty.\nThe argument that suggests criminal behavior stems from a person's nature is comprehensible. To begin with, proponents of this view contend that individuals with personality traits like greed, selfishness, or cruelty are more predisposed to criminal activities than those with kinder attributes. They are inclined to display callousness towards others in pursuit of their self-interest. Furthermore, individuals afflicted with psychological issues such as sociopathy or disorders may commit violent acts to derive satisfaction or excitement. In fact, many acts of violence and sadistic crimes perpetrated by serial killers are driven by pleasure or satisfaction.\nOn the contrary, there are several reasons why I believe that crime primarily results from social problems and poverty. This is due to the hardships in life, limited opportunities, financial insecurity, social inequality, and abuse that often lead people towards criminal activities. These circumstances can induce feelings of frustration, helplessness, and depression, which may ultimately push individuals into engaging in criminal behavior as a means of escape or survival.

Personally, I believe that both views are worth taking into consideration, and the choice should be up to each individual depending on their career purposes.\nThe argument in favor of attending university or college after finishing high school is largely based around the idea that from many employers??perspectives, university graduates possess qualities valued by most recruiters such as dedication and perseverance. Completing a university program requires commitment and the ability to overcome challenges, traits that are highly regarded in the job market. In addition to this, coming fresh out of high school, without proper education and career guidance from university, students may make ill-considered career decisions. For example, many youngsters are willing to give up the opportunity of being educated to pursue careers based solely on trends such as content creators or influencers on social networking sites. Without proper knowledge of the job market and a clear understanding of their strengths, they soon are likely to be disillusioned by the job. Facing the initial failure at a very young age potentially causes a sense of frustration and loss of confidence which result in devastating effects on their development later in life.\nConversely, there are good grounds for arguing that undertaking early employment will be of more benefit for young individuals. Firstly, instead of dedicating a significant budget to further education, employment enables them to make sufficient monthly income which can help alleviate the financial burden for families. Early employment, in this case, is considered to be the better choice for those who are underprivileged or have limited access to further education. Secondly, obtaining a job at an earlier stage of life may allow youngsters to shorten the path to a successful career, especially for those who desire to pursue trade-based professions. Practical experience gained in this kind of workplace often surpasses what can be obtained through academic settings.\nWhile there are strong arguments on both sides of the case, my personal belief is that the choice of whether to pursue further education or undertake early employment holds its own merits and should be based on an individual's career goals and circumstances. Both paths can lead to success, and the decision should be made thoughtfully, considering one's strengths, aspirations, and opportunities.\n"

A good example of this is Hoi An ancient town, which attracts more than 5 million tourists each year, including 4 million foreign visitors.\nNevertheless, there are compelling reasons why I believe spending money to build new public buildings is also a good solution. It can replace the old buildings and become a new symbol of the country. Today, many buildings have ceased to be preserved and have been dismantled. Soon, there will be many more buildings in a similar state, and in such cases, we need to construct new public buildings to maintain the cultural value of the country. This will result in the country having more famous monuments that enhance the nation's identity and pride. In short, having new buildings will contribute to the development of the country.\nIn conclusion, I partially concur with this argument because building more new buildings is important, but renovating the existing ones is equally important.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's world, environmental degradation and unhealthy lifestyle choices significantly contribute to the deterioration of human health. This essay aims to outline some practical solutions that should be implemented to enhance people's overall well-being.\nFirst and foremost, it is highly recommended that individuals make adjustments to certain habits that have adverse effects on their health, such as smoking or excessive alcohol consumption. This is primarily because tobacco and alcoholic beverages contain a plethora of toxic substances that can lead to severe health issues, including stomachaches, Alzheimer's disease, and, in the worst-case scenarios, various types of cancer. Additionally, there should be stringent measures in place to promote a balanced diet. To be more specific, people ought to consume a wide variety of nutritious foods and reduce their intake of fats. This dietary change can help individuals increase their energy levels, improve bodily functions, and prevent weight gain.\nThere is no doubt that technological advancements have significantly contributed to a sedentary lifestyle. An illustrative example of this is the growing addiction to internet browsing, where people tend to fixate on screens, engaging in activities like gaming, watching movies, or viewing short videos without engaging in physical activities. Therefore, it is imperative that efforts be focused on incorporating daily exercise routines, such as swimming, meditation, or yoga, to enhance the immune and cardiovascular systems. Lastly, due to demanding work schedules, people often find themselves under significant stress. Thus, it is advisable for individuals to engage in recreational activities to reduce stress levels and enhance their mental well-being.\nIn conclusion, as discussed earlier, making changes to unhealthy habits, adopting a nutritious diet, engaging in regular exercise, and finding ways to alleviate stress are crucial methods for improving both physical and mental health.\n"

      "paragraph": "Developing countries, such as Vietnam, grapple with a multitude of issues, encompassing environmental and socio-economic concerns. Among these, one of the most pressing problems is the environmental harm stemming from the surge in consumer goods production. This essay aims to elucidate the causes behind this detrimental trend and subsequently propose viable solutions.\nOne key factor contributing to this issue is the manufacturing industry's substantial water usage, primarily for washing, cleaning, and the operation of machinery and equipment. Moreover, businesses often dispose of their waste into water bodies and opt for urban locations for their facilities, imperiling the well-being of both humans and wildlife. Notably, a significant portion of patients suffers from health ailments such as heart conditions, lung infections, respiratory issues, and cancer, all of which can be attributed to air pollution. Additionally, due to climate change and the occurrence of severe natural disasters like earthquakes and floods, factories may emit harmful gases. For example, in India, it is common for individuals to establish small home-based businesses, which can exacerbate the risk of disasters.\nTo address these concerns, several recommendations can be made to rectify legal infringements committed by businesses and individuals contributing to environmental pollution. This entails stringent enforcement of environmental regulations to hold law-breaking businesses accountable. Furthermore, companies should invest in advancements and adopt state-of-the-art technologies aimed at curbing air pollution. For instance, a majority of European enterprises operate under the oversight of the European Environment Agency and utilize clean energy sources such as solar and wind power in their production processes, minimizing harm to the environment. By doing so, industries can actively contribute to societal growth and environmental preservation.\nIn conclusion, it is imperative for both individuals and organizations to safeguard the environment through initiatives such as waste recycling and the adoption of eco-friendly practices. This is crucial as the proliferation of consumer products is directly linked to the expanding global population. By embracing sustainable approaches, we can mitigate the adverse effects of heightened consumer goods production on the environment and work towards a more ecologically sound future.\n"

Consequently, it is widely argued that individuals work diligently to enhance their financial prospects. Despite the numerous advantages of this viewpoint, I respectfully disagree, and I will elucidate my reasons below.\nFirst and foremost, there are individuals who exert significant effort in their professions because they genuinely enjoy the work they do and possess a natural aptitude for it. It is evident that engaging in a job without passion and dedication does not result in productivity. This ultimately implies that when one is passionate about their job, they tend to be more productive, committed, and efficient, which, in turn, leads to superior performance and potential opportunities for career advancement. Furthermore, some individuals choose careers that align with their strengths. For instance, those with an altruistic desire to make a positive impact on the world may find fulfillment in roles such as social work or teaching.\nMoreover, some people exert themselves in their careers due to the conducive work environment they are a part of. Those who have a strong desire for recognition often seek a supportive workplace where their superiors and colleagues treat them with respect and appreciation. This fosters an environment that encourages employees to assume additional responsibilities, resulting in a strong work ethic and substantial personal growth.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that money offers numerous benefits to workers, I firmly believe that it is not the sole driving force behind their efforts. There are various other compelling reasons, as discussed above, that motivate individuals to work hard. I am of the opinion that people are more likely to experience a heightened sense of satisfaction when they draw motivation from factors beyond financial gain.\n"

      "paragraph": "Nowadays, there are differing opinions when it comes to the use of public funds for art and culture. Some argue that the government should prioritize critical areas like healthcare and education, while others advocate for equal financial support for the arts and culture. In my own view, allocating a fair amount of funding to art and culture, alongside other essential sectors, can bring substantial benefits to a nation and its people.\nThe argument against allocating funds to art and culture mainly stems from the belief that pressing issues such as healthcare and education hold greater importance. It is clear that investments in these societal endeavors are likely to yield immediate and direct effects on people's current lives and well-being, especially for those living below the poverty line. For example, in Vietnam, disadvantaged residents and those in remote areas suffer from prolonged illnesses and limited access to proper education due to the shortage of hospitals and schools. Therefore, addressing these urgent concerns and enhancing the quality of life should be a top priority for local authorities by investing in healthcare facilities and educational institutions.\nOn the other hand, there is a compelling argument in favor of allocating government funding to art and culture on par with other sectors. The primary reason behind this is that art and culture significantly contribute to the growth of the tourism industry. Take, for instance, the city of Hoi An in Vietnam. By investing in the preservation and promotion of its historic architecture, Hoi An has become a must-visit destination for tourists worldwide. This influx of tourists has led to the prosperity of local businesses, ranging from hotels to restaurants, and has substantially boosted the city's economy.\nAfter considering both perspectives, I firmly believe that while funding for sectors like healthcare and education undeniably has a profound impact on the lives of the population, the importance of financial support for art and culture should not be underestimated. It is only through a reasonable allocation of resources to all sectors that a nation and its citizens can maximize the benefits derived from them.\n"

The issue of retirement age has become increasingly contentious. A prevailing notion is that individuals should not be compelled to retire if they do not wish to do so. I firmly believe in the validity of this assertion, and this essay will elucidate the most pertinent reasons for this stance.\nOne pivotal point to consider is the wealth of experience that older individuals bring to the table, which makes a substantial contribution to organizational development. They possess the capacity to analyze strategies that enhance revenue and effectively manage human resources.\nIt is also imperative to acknowledge that individuals who continue working into their later years are more likely to remain mentally sharp and engaged. For example, in Japan, where elderly individuals often work beyond the retirement age, the average life expectancy surpasses that of many other nations, primarily due to their active involvement in work and society.\nFurthermore, there are specific scenarios in which delaying retirement becomes necessary. Many retirees look forward to having more leisure time to spend with their families and children after dedicating years to their careers. Similarly, members of the armed forces often take leave after completing their service to the nation.\nIn conclusion, despite any opposing arguments, it can be inferred that allowing elderly individuals to work until they choose to retire is a viable and beneficial option.\n"

      "paragraph": "In recent times, there has been a notable trend of people moving from rural areas to urban centers in many countries worldwide. This essay aims to discuss the reasons behind this migration and its effects on the existing city dwellers.\nFirst and foremost, the primary reason for this relocation trend is the availability of abundant job opportunities in cities. In rural regions, most jobs are connected to the agricultural sector, which is increasingly becoming mechanized, thus requiring fewer workers. Additionally, younger individuals are less inclined to engage in farming or small-scale businesses, as they aspire to pursue more advanced and diverse career paths. Since high-tech companies and financial institutions are predominantly located in urban areas, people tend to migrate to cities in pursuit of their desired professions. Moreover, the salaries offered by these technology companies and banks are significantly higher than those in the agricultural sector. For example, recent research indicates that the average salary in the banking sector is approximately twice as high as that in agriculture.\nThis migration trend leads to two noteworthy consequences. Firstly, the influx of people into cities exerts additional pressure on the existing infrastructure, resulting in overcrowding and frequent traffic congestion. This is evident in many cities worldwide, such as Bangkok, Hanoi, and Tokyo. Furthermore, the migration surge often drives up housing prices and increases competition among job seekers in the same field.\nIn conclusion, migration from rural areas to cities is an inevitable trend that necessitates close cooperation between governments, businesses, and individuals. Governments and local authorities should address the challenges posed by this trend to ensure sustainable urban development and improved living conditions for all.\n"

In the following essay, I will discuss some of the reasons for this and provide potential solutions to address these challenges.\nThere are several reasons why problems can arise when planning significant family gatherings. Firstly, it requires a substantial amount of time and effort to prepare for such an event. There are numerous tasks to attend to, especially if the celebration is hosted at home. These tasks may include food preparation, inviting friends and neighbors, cleaning, and decorating the house, among others. Consequently, those responsible for organizing these gatherings can become extremely busy, leading to exhaustion. Secondly, hosting a large family event can be financially burdensome. Many people opt for luxurious venues like hotels or restaurants, which often come with high price tags. For instance, in Vietnam, there is a tradition of hosting extravagant weddings and inviting a multitude of guests, resulting in significant financial expenditure.\nHowever, there are practical steps that can be taken to address these issues. One approach is to distribute the preparation workload among family members or consider outsourcing certain tasks to external resources. This can significantly reduce the time and effort required for preparation and cleaning, alleviating stress and enabling everyone to fully enjoy the celebration. For example, in Western countries, there is a trend towards private weddings, which are more intimate and include only close family members and friends. Additionally, individuals should carefully evaluate their budget and consider hosting smaller-scale events at suitable restaurants. Undoubtedly, opting for a more modest wedding can lead to cost savings that can be allocated to future plans.\nIn conclusion, while organizing a large wedding or family celebration can be both time-consuming and financially demanding, there are effective solutions available. People should make thoughtful decisions that suit their circumstances and help optimize their budget.\n"

Some argue that these inventions are making people less socially interactive. In my view, I partially agree with this notion, and it's a topic of substantial debate.\nOn the one hand, technological advancements have revolutionized communication, enabling people in developed societies to connect with individuals worldwide. For example, through the internet, we can easily reach out to our relatives or friends, regardless of their location. These devices are used by individuals of all ages, from young children to adults. In contrast to the past, when people relied on letters for communication, which could take weeks to receive and respond to, today's mobile phones allow us to access a wealth of information with just a few taps on the screen. This accessibility extends to various aspects of our lives, from health to work, helping us maintain emotional connections with our families.\nOn the other hand, the excessive use of high-tech devices can lead to a gradual disconnect within families, particularly in terms of face-to-face communication. For instance, it is evident that children with thick glasses often immerse themselves in video games on television and smart electronic devices, sometimes failing to greet their parents when they return home. Similarly, adults become engrossed in the virtual world behind their screens, spending hours on social networks like Facebook or Twitter, seemingly losing touch with their true selves. When an environment emerges where everyone relies solely on mobile communication, with minimal face-to-face interaction, it can have a detrimental effect on our connections with others.\nIn conclusion, while concerns about the diminishing interpersonal interactions in society are valid, we cannot overlook the undeniable benefits that modern technology offers for rapid and convenient communication in today's world.\n"

In my view, the choice should be based on individual circumstances.\nCertainly, allowing students to voice their thoughts and ideas can significantly enhance the educational environment and the overall schooling system. When students can confidently point out any inaccuracies or inappropriate teaching methods employed by their teachers, it encourages educators to acknowledge their mistakes and make necessary adjustments. This fosters a friendly atmosphere where both teachers and students can better understand each other, creating a more inclusive learning environment. Therefore, encouraging learners to provide constructive criticism and feedback to their educators is essential for maintaining a less hostile and more cooperative atmosphere.\nHowever, despite the many advantages of allowing students to critique their teachers, there are also potential drawbacks. Foremost among these concerns is the possibility that some students may lack appreciation and respect for their teachers or even their parents when engaged in arguments. For instance, in Western countries, children have the right to debate the quality of their education, but due to their immaturity, they may struggle to perceive and respond appropriately in a social context. This can result in disrespectful behavior and a disregard for authority, as students may question the validity of their teachers' feedback and think their own ideas and opinions are superior. Consequently, if students are granted excessive authority, it may lead to disobedience and disruptions in the classroom.\nIn conclusion, empowering children to evaluate and provide feedback on their teachers is a sensible and educationally beneficial approach.

Nevertheless, some argue that the true gauge of a great nation lies in the overall well-being of its people, as this is ultimately the primary goal of any nation. Indeed, experts have already evaluated this aspect and ranked countries worldwide using the Human Development Index (HDI), which takes into account six key factors: GDP per capita, life expectancy, health, freedom to make life choices, without being influenced by a nation's wealth or stage of development.\nDonald Trump's famous slogan, \"Make America great again,\" has become a political catchphrase. This slogan prompts us to question whether America has ever been truly great. From an outsider's perspective, the nation has not achieved this status, despite its impressive scientific achievements. What truly makes America great is the idea of the \"American dream\" ??a utopia where everyone is treated equally and given the opportunity to realize their full potential. However, this notion appears deceptive when we consider America's crime rates, poverty levels, and recurring incidents of white supremacy. Economists have pointed out that America is perceived as great only if you are financially prosperous.\nInterestingly, some citizens in Finland, which ranks among the top five nations in HDI, claim to be living the \"American dream,\" as revealed in an interview by Nowthis Originals. Public perception continues to be influenced by proponents of this concept. Nevertheless, those who critically analyze the fabric of the US social system may have different perspectives regarding job prospects and living standards. For instance, Vietnamese students often apply for post-graduate courses in Nordic countries, which consistently rank high in terms of general welfare. This indicates that such countries are seen as desirable and livable by those seeking better opportunities.\nIn conclusion, the achievements of a nation's rulers, artists, or scientists are not strong indicators of the well-being of its citizens, which is the primary determinant of a nation's greatness.

The primary rationale behind this is that art and culture offer immense benefits to both the nation and its citizens. Artworks with cultural significance, such as Dong Ho paintings or Bat Trang ceramics, serve as representations of a nation's history and identity.

In my perspective, I concur with this assertion, and I will present some arguments to support my stance.\nTo commence, the number of individuals utilizing devices capable of connecting to the internet, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, is experiencing a significant surge. This phenomenon is primarily attributed to the portability of these devices, allowing users to access information from various locations, ranging from coffee shops to supermarkets. For instance, a tourist may opt to use their smartphone to watch the news on VTV GO while aboard a train instead of relying on a conventional television at home. Furthermore, owing to technological advancements, the internet enables swift data sharing between two devices within a matter of seconds. Take Facebook as an exemplar; users of this platform can effortlessly share their favorite videos with their close friends using the platform's sharing function.\nAnother rationale supporting the notion that the internet exerts a more substantial influence on the majority is the presence of distinctive online content that television lacks. In essence, these unique contents captivate greater attention from online users owing to their allure. For example, certain dance challenge videos can only be accessed by internet users because such content is not deemed suitable for television broadcast. Additionally, the internet serves as a gateway to an extensive array of data across various domains, including finance, science, entertainment, and countless others. This accessibility benefits not only students who can broaden their knowledge by watching subject-related videos on platforms like YouTube but also entrepreneurs who can obtain work-related information from the internet.\nIn conclusion, I am in agreement with the idea that the internet wields a more significant impact on people's lives than television, primarily because it enjoys greater popularity among the masses.\n"

In my view, prioritizing the improvement of existing public transport is a more favorable option.\nOn one hand, the development of high-speed railway networks can greatly facilitate access to various parts of the world. For instance, Sa Pa, a remote mountainous region in Northern Vietnam, previously suffered from an underdeveloped transportation infrastructure. Travelers used to endure lengthy journeys of approximately 6 to 8 hours to reach the city center, either by buses or private vehicles, resulting in significant discomfort. Nevertheless, the Vietnamese government's initiative to introduce a bullet train system to Sa Pa a few years ago has brought about a remarkable transformation. This initiative has effectively halved both the travel time and costs for visitors, consequently boosting tourism in the area. This example underscores the potential of fast trains to enhance travel efficiency and contribute positively to specific regions.\nOn the other hand, I believe that channeling resources into the enhancement of existing public transportation yields more advantages, taking into consideration environmental and societal factors. From an environmental perspective, buses can be rendered more eco-friendly through the adoption of advanced technologies that reduce exhaust emissions. Such innovations have the potential to significantly enhance air quality within cities, creating a healthier living environment. A case in point is the recent introduction of electric buses by the Vingroup Corporation in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, which has received favorable feedback from residents. Many people have expressed their satisfaction with electric buses, as they produce no emissions and have no adverse effects on fellow commuters.\nFrom a societal standpoint, expanding the reach of public transportation can facilitate intercity travel, particularly for residents in rural areas who often need to use two or three different modes of transport to reach their final destinations.\nIn conclusion, while investing in the construction of high-speed railway lines may lead to improved travel efficiency, I am inclined to believe that allocating more funds towards the enhancement of public transportation systems is a wiser choice, considering its positive impact on both the environment and society.\n"

Exposure to various national traditions in advance can save time and reduce the likelihood of experiencing psychological distress when residing in a new country. However, this advantage, though valuable, is hardly significant when compared to the disadvantages for nations.\nFirst and foremost, globalization poses a threat to national identities.

This is a matter of concern since it negatively impacts their well-being and overall behavior. Therefore, it is imperative to explore potential solutions to this issue.\nFirstly, it is crucial to comprehend why youngsters are less physically active in the present times. The primary reason lies in the fact that children are exceedingly preoccupied with their studies, maintaining a demanding schedule that leaves them with insufficient time for outdoor activities. They are burdened with a multitude of subjects, leading to elevated stress levels, and often making them introverted, disinclined to engage in social sports activities that require interaction with others. It is evident that sports often involve teamwork, and if children become introverted, they are less inclined to participate. Additionally, external factors come into play. The streets are crowded and potentially perilous for children to play sports. In the past, children frequently played sports in open fields, but rapid urban development has led to a scarcity of such spaces in city centers. Furthermore, another contributing factor is laziness. Nowadays, children exhibit a preference for video games over outdoor activities as the former are perceived as more captivating, appealing, and less physically demanding. Consequently, young people consider video games a more favorable choice.\nTo address these issues, several measures can be taken. Firstly, both families and schools should play a pivotal role in helping children recognize the myriad benefits of participating in sports, including maintaining good health, reducing stress, and enhancing vitality. Secondly, to address the problem of inadequate play spaces, the government should allocate resources to construct safe recreational areas for children. Parents can also allocate quality time to play with their children or supervise them during outdoor activities. In order to tackle the issue of overburdened study schedules, parents should establish a well-organized timetable for their children. Schools should also incorporate sports-related lessons into their curriculum to encourage students to develop physically as well as academically.\nIn conclusion, sports are essential for both young and old individuals.

Firstly, such experiences expose young people to cultural diversity. Every place has its unique culture and customs, and this exposure can broaden their horizons and expand their social circles as they form relationships with local friends. Additionally, children tend to adapt to and embrace new lifestyles in these different areas. Moreover, the frequent moves encourage children to become more independent, reducing over-dependence on their parents. Lastly, moving often necessitates adjusting to new environments and facing unfamiliar situations, fostering resilience and adaptability. For example, when living abroad, students may need to learn to prepare their own meals.\nOn the flip side, I am convinced that there are more detrimental aspects to frequent relocations. A significant concern is the impact on children's emotional well-being. Young children may struggle to form meaningful and long-lasting relationships because they do not have sufficient time to build friendships, leading to feelings of isolation and even depression. It's undeniable that this pattern can disrupt and delay their academic progress. Students often have to adjust to new school curricula due to differences in educational systems, which can be time-consuming and academically challenging. Additionally, trying to catch up with new friends academically can lead to decreased school performance, which is a waste of time and effort.\nIn conclusion, despite the undeniable advantages of living in different places due to parents' transferable jobs, the disadvantages related to mental well-being and educational continuity are still outweighed by the more significant positive aspects.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's world, it has become quite common for people to prefer purchasing items from famous brand stores. This trend can be attributed to the desire for unique products of high quality. In my view, this is a positive development because the advantages outweigh the drawbacks.\nTo begin with, customers are inclined to choose famous brands primarily because of their reputation for maintaining high standards. Brand stores meticulously scrutinize the materials, designs, and colors of their products to ensure they offer the best quality. These efforts leave a positive impression on the market and enhance the acceptability of their products due to their quality and variety. For instance, \"Nike\" is a globally renowned footwear brand known for its durable shoe soles, which have garnered widespread trust. Additionally, many famous brands often collaborate with celebrities for product endorsements. This strategic move not only leads to increased brand recognition but also drives sales, as these well-known figures attract a large following of fans who are more likely to purchase the brand's products.\nNevertheless, it's important to acknowledge that shopping at brand stores can be more expensive compared to purchasing non-branded items. However, it's worth noting that buyers don't need to make frequent purchases because branded goods are generally more durable than their non-branded counterparts. Take the \"iPhone,\" for example; it may come with a hefty price tag, but it offers longevity and a wider range of functions compared to many local mobile phones.\nIn conclusion, the preference for shopping at renowned brand stores is on the rise among the general population. While it is true that prices can be higher, these products are guaranteed to be of superior quality compared to generic alternatives. Therefore, I believe that the trend of buying famous brand items is a positive development that offers consumers lasting value.\n"

In my view, this development is influenced by various factors, and I firmly believe that the substantial benefits of online learning for university students outweigh its drawbacks.\nIt is true that there are a few disadvantages that should be taken into consideration. First and foremost, in underprivileged nations, only a small number of students have access to advanced gadgets such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones to participate in online courses. For instance, poverty has a devastating impact on the enrollment of young people in universities in countries like India or Africa. In other words, some argue that certain circumstances make it necessary for students to attend traditional offline classes, especially considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn the flip side, despite the aforementioned downsides, the advantages of integrating the internet into university courses are far more significant.

      "paragraph": "In recent decades, there has been a noticeable increase in life expectancy in the developed world, leading to an aging population. This essay will examine the primary issues associated with this trend and suggest practical solutions.\nOn the one hand, there are several problems linked to the rising life expectancy. Perhaps the most significant issue is the high cost of providing healthcare services for senior citizens. It is undeniable that as people live longer, they are more likely to experience physical and mental health conditions, placing a heavy reliance on state-funded retirement pensions that may require medical support. Consequently, governments may be compelled to reduce funding for essential sectors, negatively impacting a country's sustainable development. Another problem is the reduced productivity of the elderly in the workforce. Older individuals often struggle to maintain high levels of productivity in physical and intellectual tasks, potentially limiting job opportunities for the younger generation.\nGiven that this phenomenon can result in severe and wide-ranging problems, immediate action should be taken by both governments and individuals to address the aforementioned issues. One effective solution is to promote the importance of a healthy lifestyle among the elderly. Without a doubt, if older individuals gain a better understanding of how to maintain a healthy lifestyle, they can reduce the occurrence of preventable illnesses. This, in turn, would lessen the burden on state pensions and lead to a corresponding reduction in government expenditure on public healthcare services. Another effective approach is the development and implementation of high-technology and labor-saving devices in the workforce. Undoubtedly, the use of robotic technology in workplaces can significantly reduce the physical and mental strain on human workers, resulting in substantial labor savings.\nIn conclusion, while the increasing average life expectancy can contribute to national development, it also brings challenges such as rising healthcare costs and reduced workforce productivity. It is crucial for governments and individuals to take proactive measures to address these issues, including promoting healthy lifestyles and adopting labor-saving technologies in the workplace.\n"

They seek individuals who not only possess talent but also excel as team players. I wholeheartedly support this trend, and in the following paragraphs, I will present the reasons for my endorsement.\nFirstly, brainstorming is crucial for generating fresh ideas. Scientists often arrive at conclusions through in-depth debates and discussions. Problems that seem insurmountable when tackled alone can become more manageable with the assistance of others. Diverse perspectives can lead to revolutionary thinking. Moreover, teamwork enhances individual morale, as recent studies have indicated that people derive greater satisfaction from problem-solving as part of a team. Collaboration also fosters a spirit of learning and alleviates the workload. Research has shown that tasks that appear Herculean for a single individual become achievable when two work together.\nNo one person possesses all the skills required to complete a task. For instance, person A might excel in coding within domain A but lack expertise in domain B. In such cases, person A can benefit from the skills of another proficient in domain B, and vice versa. This collaborative approach facilitates skill-building, allowing team members to expand their knowledge base. It instills a sense of worthiness in their competencies and encourages them to explore new areas, buoyed by their teammates' support.\nWhile some argue that teamwork might dilute individual ownership of a task, properly managed teams can be exceptionally productive.

This essay aims to outline the causes behind this trend and its effects on the existing urban population.\nFirstly, cities tend to offer more job opportunities, higher wages, and better access to education. Rural residents often move to cities in search of improved economic prospects for themselves and their families. The growth of industries and urban infrastructure in cities creates a demand for labor, attracting individuals from rural areas who may have previously engaged in agriculture or other traditional occupations. For example, salaries in the banking sector are often considerably higher than those in the agricultural sector in countries like Vietnam. Additionally, cities boast a higher number of educational institutions with better quality, making them appealing to families who wish to provide their children with enhanced educational opportunities. Urban areas may also provide a more diverse and vibrant social and cultural environment, which can enhance individuals' social and academic skills.\nHowever, the influx of rural migrants can lead to increased competition for jobs, housing, and public services in cities. This competition can result in wage stagnation, strain on urban infrastructure, rising property prices, and increased renting costs, negatively affecting the affordability for existing city residents. The sudden increase in population can put pressure on transportation, healthcare, and education systems, potentially leading to overcrowding and reduced service quality. Furthermore, the introduction of rural traditions into urban areas can diversify the city's culture, but it may also create tensions or conflicts in certain areas.\nNonetheless, urbanization can stimulate economic growth by creating a larger labor force and market. Consequently, city dwellers can benefit from increased economic opportunities and access to goods and services. Cities often serve as hubs of innovation and development, which can enhance technology, healthcare, and overall quality of life for both rural migrants and existing urban residents. The interaction of people from diverse backgrounds in cities can promote social integration and tolerance, ultimately fostering a more inclusive society over time.\nIn conclusion, rural-to-urban migration is driven by the pursuit of a better quality of life and a more promising future.

It is undeniable that in numerous countries, individuals seeking employment often face the necessity of relocating, leaving their friends and families behind. While this practice has its drawbacks, the advantages may outweigh them.\nOn the one hand, there can be a modest disadvantage to relocating. One possible issue is the emotional distance people may feel when living far away from their parents and friends. This can be attributed to the need to find employment to support themselves, which often requires them to separate from their primary sources of emotional support. This situation is exemplified by students studying abroad in foreign countries, who often experience feelings of isolation and stress as they grapple with different cultures. Consequently, mental well-being plays a pivotal role in personal development and can help in managing negative emotions. If individuals lack psychological stability, it can lead to a sense of imbalance in their lives.\nNevertheless, pursuing a career in a different location can offer substantial advantages that overshadow these negative impacts. The most evident benefit is the wealth of knowledge and experiences gained when residing away from one's hometown. These experiences are crucial in helping individuals identify potential opportunities when they enter the workforce. This is why an increasing number of young adults are willing to accept the idea of being separated from their close acquaintances.

Some argue that politicians bear the primary responsibility for tackling these issues. However, I strongly disagree with this assertion.\nIt is understandable why many individuals believe that addressing environmental challenges should fall within the purview of politicians. They possess the authority and resources required to enact laws and policies aimed at mitigating these problems. They can implement measures such as penalties or higher taxes for industries that have a detrimental impact on the environment, like the energy sector, which emits a substantial amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. For instance, Canada has implemented carbon taxes with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and encouraging companies to invest in cleaner technology and practices. This approach not only aims to mitigate the significant effects on the ecosystem but also seeks to improve overall quality of life.\nContrary to this perspective, I firmly believe that each individual bears a responsibility for the degradation of our environment. While it is true that the energy industry plays a significant role in environmental harm, placing the sole responsibility on the government overlooks the role of personal choices, awareness, daily habits, and consumption patterns. For example, reducing personal water and energy consumption, practicing recycling, and utilizing public transportation are all actions that, when adopted by many individuals, can contribute to a reduction in carbon emissions and the protection of our ecosystem.\nIn conclusion, although legislators can provide valuable support in addressing environmental degradation, it is crucial not to disregard the individual's role in this endeavor.

This essay will explore the potential reasons behind this trend and propose practical solutions to address the issue.\nThe high incidence of juvenile delinquency can be linked to two primary factors. Firstly, the absence of parental supervision can lead teenagers towards criminal behavior. When parents neglect their children, youngsters often find themselves with more freedom and less regulation. Additionally, due to their relatively young age, they lack the necessary life experiences, making them susceptible to engaging in unlawful activities. Secondly, technological advancements play a role in influencing children to engage in wrongful acts. Those who frequently watch violent or action films and play video games may be easily swayed towards imitating these virtual actions, considering them as cool. Consequently, there is a higher likelihood of them engaging in illegal activities.\nNonetheless, there are several viable methods to tackle this problem. Firstly, parents must take responsibility for their children by dedicating more time to interact with them. When young individuals receive proper education and guidance, they become more aware of the severe consequences they may face if they commit any form of crime, thus deterring them from engaging in criminal activities. Secondly, it is advisable to reduce teenagers' exposure to violent video games and movies. Instead, encouraging them to participate in outdoor activities with their peers or watch films with less violent content can be a more positive approach. As a result, this strategy may contribute to a decrease in the incidence of crimes among teenagers.\nIn conclusion, the high percentage of crimes attributed to juveniles primarily arises from the lack of parental care and the influence of modern technology.

From my perspective, the increasing prevalence of advertising presents more challenges than advantages and can significantly contribute to consumer skepticism and aversion to advertisements.\nOn one hand, the widespread use of advertising offers substantial benefits to both businesses and consumers. Firstly, promoting advertisements can bolster businesses by increasing sales and revenues. Moreover, thanks to advertisements, more consumers can discover specific products, leading to increased demand. This, in turn, enables businesses to expand their production capacity, take advantage of economies of scale to reduce production costs, gain a competitive edge, and stand out in crowded markets. Additionally, when companies run advertisements, they have more opportunities to gather feedback from consumers regarding product quality, design, and areas for improvement. This feedback is beneficial for businesses as it helps them understand their product's performance and make necessary improvements. Consequently, they can build a reputable brand image and foster trust among consumers.\nHowever, I believe that excessive exposure to advertisements may lead to counterproductive and bothersome outcomes. Firstly, the constant bombardment of similar advertisements makes consumers skeptical about the authenticity of a particular product, making it challenging to distinguish genuine offerings. Moreover, the saturation of advertisements can cultivate a sense of aversion among people. Consequently, individuals may actively seek ways to avoid exposure to advertisements whenever possible, such as using ad-blockers and subscribing to premium services that offer an ad-free experience.\nIn conclusion, the prevalence of advertising offers substantial benefits to both businesses and consumers in terms of production efficiency, pricing, and product quality.

This preference for personal vehicles encourages the use of cars.\nNonetheless, there are specific measures that can mitigate this pressing issue. Firstly, governments should implement policies aimed at enhancing public transportation infrastructure. Lowering ticket prices would incentivize people to opt for public transport when traveling. Secondly, local authorities should increase the cost of fuel for cars and impose restrictions on private vehicles entering city centers.

One solution is for businesses to incorporate eco-friendly design principles into their products. This means using biodegradable packaging, facilitating recycling, and promoting reusability to reduce waste generation.\nAnother approach involves raising consumer awareness and promoting responsible behavior. Consumers should be educated about the environmental consequences of their choices, support companies that adopt sustainable business practices, and opt for reusable products over disposable ones.\nTo tackle the problems of resource depletion and air pollution, industries should embrace environmentally-friendly manufacturing practices.

While this viewpoint holds merit to some extent, I am inclined to the opinion that monetary compensation should not be prioritized over other factors, for the following reasons.\nOn one hand, it is indisputable that money is indispensable for meeting one's basic daily needs. For instance, we all require financial resources to cover expenses such as housing, bills, healthcare, and infrastructure. For most individuals, ensuring the fulfillment of these necessities and maintaining a reasonable quality of life takes precedence. If people opt for careers that lean towards personal enjoyment or non-monetary aspects, they might encounter challenges in sustaining themselves in a competitive world. For example, amateur artists and musicians often pursue careers they are passionate about, but this may not provide them with a sustainable means to live comfortably and support their families.\nOn the other hand, I would argue that other elements directly associated with one's job are equally vital as money. Firstly, personal relationships and the workplace environment play a pivotal role in job selection. Having supportive supervisors or amiable colleagues, for instance, can significantly impact the happiness and overall quality of life of workers. Furthermore, many individuals derive job satisfaction from their professional accomplishments, the skills they acquire, and the positions they attain, rather than merely focusing on amassing wealth.

      "paragraph": "In today's world, it is increasingly common for older individuals to remain employed and compete with younger ones for job positions. This can have a negative impact on society and requires government intervention to find solutions.\nAllowing seniors to continue working can lead to several societal problems. Firstly, when older people stay in their jobs for extended periods, it becomes more challenging for young individuals to secure suitable employment in an already highly competitive job market, exacerbated by overpopulation. This is primarily because senior workers can easily gain a competitive advantage over their younger counterparts in fields that require deep knowledge and practical experience. Moreover, in some families where young adults struggle to find job opportunities, older individuals may have no choice but to become the primary breadwinners. Working during retirement age, a time when elderly individuals should be relaxing and enjoying their lives with their families, can have a detrimental impact on their physical and mental health.\nTo address these issues, various measures can be proposed with government support. One effective approach to reducing high youth unemployment is for the government to establish fixed quotas for different types of jobs, along with specific age limits for retirement. For example, in labor-intensive fields such as manufacturing, which may not be suitable for older workers, retirement ages could be set at 60 for men and 55 for women. Another solution is to engage older citizens in lighter roles, such as coaching or consulting. These types of work can provide financial support for their families while not adversely affecting their health.\nIn conclusion, it is imperative for governments to adopt solutions to tackle this problem and prevent high levels of unemployment among young adults.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's fast-paced world, an increasing number of people are relying heavily on technological devices like computers and mobile phones, which can have a negative impact on face-to-face communication. From my perspective, I firmly agree with this viewpoint for the following reasons.\nThere are several reasons why individuals tend to use high-tech devices in their daily lives. First and foremost, this reliance on technology can adversely affect interpersonal skills. With the convenience of these devices, people can easily keep in touch with their friends or establish new relationships through modern applications such as Facebook, Zalo, or Twitter. This leads people to believe that real-life conversations are not as essential. For example, research conducted by Central Queensland University suggests that most individuals are more likely to interact with their friends and family members through advanced technological gadgets compared to those who attend face-to-face meetings.\nOn the other hand, it is evident that such trends can also contribute to social isolation among individuals. Many people fail to build strong relationships with their families or peers in the real world as they spend an excessive amount of time engrossed in their technical devices. This can result in them feeling less confident and capable when communicating with others. To illustrate, today's youth often spend their time taking photos, chatting with friends, and ignoring the activities happening around them. They are more inclined to share their emotions with virtual friends rather than their family members or true friends. Therefore, if people excessively use mobile phones or computers, their communication skills, such as maintaining eye contact and expressing themselves through body language, are likely to significantly diminish.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that technical gadgets hold a crucial place in our lives; however, they can have detrimental impacts on direct face-to-face interaction.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's world, many young people are concerned about the influence of peer pressure on their behavior and choices. In my view, the advantages of this phenomenon outweigh its disadvantages.\nCertainly, there are valid reasons to believe that peer pressure among peers of the same age can be highly beneficial. Firstly, it's undeniable that this competitive environment can significantly enhance students' academic achievements. The reason for this is that the outstanding accomplishments of their friends often serve as role models, motivating them to strive for excellence and overall growth. Consequently, students can set higher goals for themselves and experience greater job satisfaction in their future careers. An illustrative example of this is the use of public ranking assessments in academic settings, which actively promote peer pressure. These assessments not only evaluate students' progress but also help them identify and improve their areas of weakness. Additionally, the concept of peer pressure fosters stronger friendships and imparts valuable skills such as teamwork, leadership, and interpersonal communication. In essence, when students feel pressured by their peers' academic achievements, they are more likely to respect these role models and form study groups, enhancing their learning experience.\nHowever, it's important to acknowledge that peer pressure can also have a detrimental impact on the mental well-being of individuals. For instance, this pressure can lead to increased stress levels among young people, causing them to experience anxiety and depression when expressing their own ideas. In some tragic cases, such emotional turmoil can even lead to instances of youth suicide, as exemplified by a Vietnamese teenager in 2020 who took his own life by jumping from a tall building. His actions were seen as a protest against his father's insistence on prolonged study, which offered little room for entertainment or recreation, and the immense pressure exerted by the academic achievements of his peers.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that peer pressure can have negative effects on students' performance and behavior, I am inclined to believe that its positive aspects outweigh the negatives. This phenomenon not only enhances academic outcomes but also promotes friendship and the development of essential life skills.\n"

      "paragraph": "Some individuals argue that rather than trying to prevent climate change, we should explore ways to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nIn my opinion, I partially disagree with the idea presented.\nOn the one hand, I acknowledge the importance of learning to cope with climate change. Firstly, it is evident that shifts in weather patterns are inevitable consequences of socio-economic development. Specifically, to meet the growing needs of a continuously expanding population, humans consume more energy, much of which comes from carbon-based sources and fossil fuels. Consequently, the emissions released from factories and vehicles contribute to global warming, resulting in climate change. Secondly, embracing climate crisis as an unavoidable phenomenon offers a cost-effective and straightforward solution to address this situation. For instance, global warming, which may lead to ice cap melting and subsequent floods, can be mitigated by constructing dikes and designing flood-resistant homes. Moreover, implementing these measures is less technologically demanding than reversing the melting process.\nOn the other hand, I believe that humans should actively seek ways to prevent or at least slow down the process of climate change. Firstly, interventions are necessary to curb climate shifts before they become irreversible. For example, research indicates that as sea levels rise, a greater percentage of the world's population will risk becoming homeless. Furthermore, if climate change continues unchecked, Earth could soon become uninhabitable, which would be tantamount to the extinction of humanity. Additionally, with the advancements in science and technology, preventing climate change has become increasingly achievable. To be more specific, modern devices enable people to harness renewable energy sources on a large scale, potentially replacing environmentally harmful sources. Similarly, high technology aids in more effective waste treatment, reducing its impact on the environment.\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge that humans should explore ways to adapt to climate change, I firmly believe that preventing and mitigating this process is of utmost importance, particularly given the progress in technology and science.\n"

      "paragraph": "\"Some people believe that individuals are born with innate leadership abilities, while others argue that leadership skills can be developed through training and practice. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives and express my support for the latter view.\nOn one hand, there are several reasons why some individuals think that leadership skills are inherent. Firstly, those who possess charismatic qualities for leadership can bring significant benefits both personally and collectively. They are often confident in public speaking and adept at persuading others, which can be a valuable advantage when organizing and uniting a team. Secondly, certain qualities such as perception, presentation, and courage can be inherited within families. For instance, some conglomerates pass down the position of chairman from one generation to the next within their bloodline. These talented heirs have successfully propelled their businesses to prominence in their respective fields.\nOn the other hand, I align myself with the belief that leadership is a skill that can be acquired. Leadership development begins with small actions, such as dressing more formally and practicing voice intonation. This is because when individuals work on improving their weaknesses, they gain confidence and passion, making it easier for them to assume leadership roles and continue their personal growth. Moreover, leadership can be cultivated through extensive training and hands-on experience. Consider the example of Adam Khoo, who, despite being considered dull-witted and apathetic during his youth, transformed into the youngest millionaire in Singapore with the guidance of a specific program. Nowadays, there is a wide range of programs designed to help individuals enhance their skills in areas such as strategic planning, team management, and public speaking, all of which offer opportunities to learn from experienced professionals.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that individuals with inherent leadership abilities can bring various advantages in certain situations, I firmly support the view that leadership is a learned quality that can be acquired through training and practice.\"\n"

      "paragraph": "People have differing views regarding how to reduce crime. In my opinion, both giving longer prison sentences and implementing various alternative measures can work together effectively to prevent crime.\nOn the one hand, longer prison sentences are among the most effective measures to reduce crime. Firstly, extended incarceration is necessary as it can serve as a strong deterrent for those contemplating criminal acts. If potential offenders are aware that they will face the loss of their freedom, social isolation, and separation from their loved ones when engaging in criminal activities, they are less likely to commit such acts. Secondly, extended prison time provides offenders with an opportunity to reflect on their actions and reform their behavior. Upon their release, they are put on probation, and law enforcement officers closely monitor them, encouraging them to make positive changes in their lives.\nOn the other hand, I believe that there are several alternative methods to limit the number of criminals that do not involve longer prison sentences. Families should invest more time in nurturing their children. To prevent juvenile crimes, parents should pay increased attention to raising and educating their children properly. Additionally, the government should provide more support to economically disadvantaged individuals, such as offering vocational training programs or unemployment benefits. Government-sponsored vocational training can equip people with skills like carpentry or electrical work. If individuals have the chance to develop personal and job-specific skills, they will possess the knowledge and capabilities to find legitimate employment, reducing the likelihood of resorting to criminal activities due to unemployment.\nIn conclusion, while longer prison sentences can be effective in curbing crime, I believe that other measures have the potential to significantly reduce criminal activity as well.\n"

      "paragraph": "Some individuals hold the belief that dedicating time to reading newspapers and watching television news programs is a futile endeavor due to their perceived lack of relevance to our daily lives. In my perspective, I partially concur with this notion.\nIt is readily apparent that in today's digital age, where social media and the Internet have proliferated, people have easy access to a vast array of information, including misleading or fabricated news. This not only consumes our valuable time but also steers individuals towards erroneous beliefs and decisions. Placing trust in untrustworthy articles can give rise to various potential hazards pertaining to health, personal information, and more. For instance, individuals might haphazardly self-administer medication without consulting a medical professional if they search their symptoms online and rely on articles of dubious authenticity. Therefore, it is imperative to exercise skepticism when perusing newspapers and opt for reputable sources while avoiding sensationalistic tabloids.\nNevertheless, there are merits to watching the news for several reasons. Firstly, news reports and articles serve as a valuable source of information that can be beneficial to us, enabling people to gain insights into current events and phenomena in their everyday lives. Many of these articles and news stories are authored by experts and professionals, offering individuals valuable resources for research and study. Secondly, news coverage can play a constructive role in addressing specific issues. For example, by shedding light on the dire circumstances faced by impoverished regions across the globe, news outlets have spurred the involvement of numerous nonprofit organizations, leading to a significant reduction in famine in certain countries.\nIn conclusion, news media offers advantages to individuals by imparting knowledge and highlighting global events that demand our attention. Therefore, it would be imprudent to dismiss the act of reading articles and watching the news entirely, solely based on the presence of fake news. Maintaining a critical and discerning mindset while perusing newspapers is the most effective strategy for safeguarding oneself against misinformation.\n"

This essay aims to outline several reasons and offer potential solutions to address these issues.\nThere are several reasons why numerous learners struggle to concentrate on their studies in school. Firstly, a primary factor is the lack of sleep. In today's fast-paced world, most students lead busy lives due to their academic commitments. They not only have to deal with homework from school but also attend extra classes, leaving them with limited time for rest. As a result, many students find themselves feeling fatigued during school hours, making it challenging to focus on their studies.\nSecondly, distractions also play a significant role in hindering students' ability to pay attention in school. The proliferation of technology, such as smartphones, is a major distraction during study periods at school. Furthermore, these distractions can have a detrimental impact on their academic performance. For instance, a survey conducted in Vietnam revealed that many students achieve poor academic results due to excessive smartphone usage for gaming during study periods, which diverts their attention away from learning.\nTo address these issues, several solutions can be implemented. Firstly, parents should assist students in organizing their daily schedules to ensure they have enough time for rest and sleep. Monitoring their children's health and ensuring they adhere to a proper bedtime is crucial in this regard.\nSecondly, teachers should take measures to minimize distractions during study time, such as turning off electronic devices like smartphones to prevent them from disrupting students' focus on their studies.\nIn conclusion, maintaining a high level of concentration and attention during study sessions is crucial for every student.

People will have access to a wide array of information without incurring any costs. I wholeheartedly concur with this assertion and believe that the benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks.\nFrom a comprehensive standpoint, an array of gadgets emerges daily, catalyzing significant transformations in the printing and publishing industry. Many of these undergo profound changes. Online reading has emerged as the preferred mode of content consumption, owing to its efficiency and environmental friendliness. To expound further, individuals can stay abreast of local and global news effortlessly, with just a few clicks of a mouse. Browsing a website provides them with ample research opportunities and straightforward access to a wealth of information. This enables people to significantly reduce the time they spend gathering information, allowing them to allocate more time to absorb other essential knowledge. Recent research and surveys have demonstrated that accessing and categorizing information using online devices is both convenient and accessible, regardless of time or location.\nFurthermore, the production of magazines and books no longer requires paper, leading to a reduction in the demand for trees and a decline in deforestation. This practice plays a pivotal role in safeguarding our forests and the environment, potentially preventing various natural disasters in the future.

From my perspective, I partially agree with this viewpoint, but I would argue that social media also has beneficial aspects for people's lives.\nOn the one hand, it is understandable why social networking sites can have numerous negative impacts on people and society. First of all, frequent use of social media might cause some serious health issues. To be more specific, excessive use of social media can lead to constant interaction with screens, which is extremely harmful to eyesight and can result in eye problems. Additionally, spending too much time on social networking sites can lead to internet addiction, causing individuals to neglect physical activities and adopt a sedentary lifestyle, which can lead to obesity. Finally, one of the main detrimental effects is the risk of revealing too much personal information, which can be exploited by others with bad intentions, such as stealing your money.\nOn the other hand, there are various compelling reasons why this sector has positive impacts on society. One of the most significant advantages is that it allows companies to conduct business online and enables customers to shop online. For instance, during the outbreak of the coronavirus, the government prohibited people from going outside, leading to the closure of many physical stores. However, social media platforms like Facebook or TikTok offer various channels to meet the shopping needs of individuals. Therefore, it helps boost the profits of corporations and ensures that essential goods are still accessible to the public. Another benefit is that using social media helps people strengthen their connections with each other. Social media plays an important role as a bridge that facilitates quick communication within society, especially among people from different parts of the world. People can also make use of helpful features like video calls on social media, allowing family members to see and hear each other, regardless of geographical distance.\nIn conclusion, social media has a significant positive impact on the public, but it also has several disadvantages for individuals.\n"

While this viewpoint holds some merit, I firmly advocate that students should primarily focus on their favorite subjects.\nOn the one hand, studying all subjects can be advantageous for young learners as it offers numerous opportunities. Firstly, by engaging with a variety of subjects, adolescents can discover their aptitude and preferences. This self-discovery can later guide their choice of a major at university. Secondly, through the process of studying a wide array of subjects, teenagers can gain knowledge in diverse fields. Consequently, they can become well-rounded individuals with a broad knowledge base, qualities highly valued by reputable employers.\nOn the other hand, I wholeheartedly concur that directing teenagers' attention towards subjects they excel in or are enthusiastic about is the most optimal method of learning, and here's why. Firstly, this approach enhances students' learning experiences and overall well-being. Specifically, it empowers students to pursue their interests and alleviates the stress associated with excelling in less enjoyable subjects while striving for high grades across the board. Secondly, this style of learning holds significant benefits for adolescents' future careers. To elaborate, it motivates students to invest time in exploring and gaining insights into their passions, enabling them to reach their full potential and achieve superior academic performance.\nIn conclusion, while both approaches to education have their merits, it is my belief that teenagers should primarily concentrate on subjects in which they excel and feel passionate about, owing to the advantages mentioned above.\n"

      "paragraph": "It is undeniable that the mass production of consumer goods has a detrimental impact on the natural environment. This essay will initially examine some key reasons and then suggest a range of possible solutions to address these issues.\nFirst and foremost, one of the primary factors contributing to environmental damage is the rapid growth of the global population. In recent decades, the world's population has expanded significantly, leading to an increased demand for essential items such as food, clothing, and housing. This heightened demand has placed tremendous pressure on agriculture and industry, compelling them to excessively exploit land and natural resources to meet the needs of a larger population.\nAnother compelling reason is the unregulated release of toxic by-products from manufacturing processes directly into the environment. For example, in the electronics industry, hazardous substances like lead and mercury are frequently used in production. Improper disposal of electronic waste has led to soil and water contamination, resulting in adverse health effects for nearby communities.\nTo mitigate these problems, several measures should be considered. One effective approach to address overpopulation is through comprehensive sex education programs. These programs can educate individuals about the consequences of high birth rates and provide information on family planning methods. For example, countries like the Netherlands have implemented comprehensive sex education in schools, leading to a significant decrease in teenage pregnancies and overall birth rates.\nAnother viable method to reduce environmental contamination is to require companies to commit to sustainable development. This means that their manufacturing processes must be upgraded to ensure proper waste treatment before discharging waste into the environment. Additionally, companies should take responsibility for the environmental damage caused by their operations. This can include engaging in charitable activities and safeguarding the health of local residents.\nIn conclusion, overpopulation is a significant contributor to environmental degradation, aggravated by inadequate waste treatment systems. Nonetheless, effective solutions involving government initiatives and corporate responsibility, such as comprehensive sex education and sustainable development commitments, should be seriously considered.\n"

Moreover, one of the most significant concerns revolves around the issue of information security. Shoppers are often required to provide detailed personal information when making online purchases, which can lead to the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive data and its potential misuse for nefarious purposes.\nHowever, it is essential to recognize that online shopping offers a plethora of advantages for consumers. First and foremost, it saves valuable time, making it an invaluable solution for busy individuals, particularly homemakers who are occupied with various household tasks.

It is believed that sky trains offer numerous advantages, although they also come with some drawbacks. This essay will discuss both perspectives and express my viewpoint.\nOn the one hand, sky trains offer a wide range of advantages. Firstly, they significantly improve traffic flow in large cities. This is because each sky train operates on its own elevated track, separate from ground-level traffic. For example, during rush hours, commuters can avoid the traffic congestion by using sky trains. Secondly, sky trains are known for their speed and comfort compared to other forms of public transportation. They can reach speeds of over 160 kilometers per hour and provide a comfortable journey due to their dedicated overhead tracks. As a result, commuters can travel to work without being overcrowded and feeling irritated. Lastly, one of the notable benefits of sky trains is their environmental friendliness. They do not emit toxic chemical smoke into the air, making them a greener transportation option.\nOn the other hand, sky trains have their own disadvantages. The primary drawback is their costliness. Building and maintaining sky train infrastructure requires a significant amount of money. For instance, the Vietnamese government allocated a substantial portion of its budget and borrowed with interest from ODA capital to construct a sky train network. Another aspect to consider is the noise and visual pollution caused by sky trains.

In this essay, we will explore two contrasting perspectives, followed by my personal viewpoint, which aligns with the latter.\nOn one hand, there is a belief that individuals should maintain job stability for several compelling reasons. Firstly, staying in the same role provides an opportunity to accumulate valuable experience. For instance, someone who commits to a single company over the long term may be entrusted with important tasks, contributing to the enhancement of their professional qualifications and communication skills. Consequently, by undertaking such responsibilities, they are likely to establish themselves as trustworthy and respected professionals in their respective fields. Secondly, job continuity often leads to financial benefits, including seniority bonuses and company welfare packages. This not only improves their overall quality of life but also positively influences their emotional well-being.\nOn the other hand, others, including myself, advocate for job flexibility. The primary reason for this perspective is that adapting to different work environments equips individuals with diverse skills and the ability to handle unexpected situations. Consider the period during the Covid-19 pandemic, for instance; individuals who had experience in various roles were better equipped to transition to online work, engage in alternative income-generating activities such as selling clothing, and easily adapt to remote working conditions. Consequently, this flexibility not only enables them to earn more income but also ensures a higher standard of living during times of global economic uncertainty. Furthermore, by diversifying their work experiences, individuals can expand their professional networks and build valuable relationships, which can significantly benefit their career advancement, enabling them to achieve greater success.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that job stability offers certain advantages in terms of skill development and financial security, I firmly support the notion that individuals should embrace job flexibility.

Consequently, they may face the risk of performing poorly academically compared to their peers who start higher education directly, which could delay them in obtaining their bachelor's degree and hinder their future career opportunities. Additionally, some young adults may choose to forgo tertiary education after a year of working, as the appeal of earning money may be more enticing to them. Consequently, they become less likely to pursue higher education and opt for work instead.\nHowever, the benefits of taking a gap year are more substantial. In some countries, like Vietnam, many high school students are uncertain about their choice of major. This issue could be resolved if high school leavers have a dedicated year for traveling and gaining new experiences, allowing them to explore their areas of interest and make informed educational decisions. Moreover, those who take a gap year can gain an advantage over their peers by developing problem-solving and task management skills, which can be honed through such experiences. These skills are highly beneficial for their higher education endeavors, facilitating quicker and more effective learning.\nIn conclusion, despite the disadvantages related to interrupting their education, I firmly believe that the benefits in terms of academic direction and skill development outweigh the drawbacks.

However, I strongly disagree with this perspective due to its potential negative impact on work motivation and personal development.\nFirstly, my disagreement stems from the concern that people may lose their sense of dedication to their work. To elaborate, when individuals prioritize earning a higher income as their primary goal, they tend to approach their jobs solely as a means to meet their managers' requirements and complete assigned tasks. Consequently, they may be less inclined to go the extra mile or assist their colleagues. As a result, they might miss opportunities for promotions and increased wages. Furthermore, working for an extended period in a company without seeing significant financial growth can lead to feelings of discouragement and disappointment, which can significantly affect their overall productivity.\nSecondly, I disagree with the viewpoint that prioritizing salary can have adverse effects on individuals' character and behavior. This is because when people choose their profession solely based on salary considerations, they often overlook other critical factors, such as the quality of the work environment and the competence of their leaders and managers. Consequently, they might be enticed by organizations offering high pay but requiring them to engage in unethical or illegal activities. In such workplaces, they may find themselves surrounded by negative and toxic colleagues and unsophisticated managers, gradually adopting their attitudes and behaviors.\nIn conclusion, while salary is undoubtedly an important factor to consider when selecting a job, I argue that focusing exclusively on it can have detrimental effects on both one's work efficiency and personal growth.

This can open up opportunities for individuals to form new friendships.\nThe trend of investing in beauty enhancement can have both positive and negative effects on society. On the positive side, the inclination of men and women to spend money on improving their appearance provides a significant source of revenue for beauty-related businesses and companies.

To be more specific, people should incorporate a variety of nutritious foods into their daily meals while reducing their intake of fatty foods. This dietary change can help boost energy levels, enhance bodily functions, and prevent weight gain.\nUndoubtedly, technological advancements have played a significant role in promoting a sedentary lifestyle. An example of this is becoming engrossed in activities like surfing the internet, where people often spend extended periods in front of screens playing games, watching films, or viewing short videos, all without engaging in physical activities. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize regular exercise, such as swimming, meditation, or yoga, as a means to strengthen the immune system and cardiovascular health. Finally, due to the demands of a busy work schedule, people often experience high levels of stress, which can negatively impact their mental health. Consequently, it is advisable for individuals to engage in recreational activities to reduce stress and improve their overall mental well-being.\nIn conclusion, altering detrimental habits, adopting a nutritious diet, engaging in regular exercise, and managing stress are all crucial methods that play a pivotal role in improving both physical and mental health.\n"

      "paragraph": "In this modern era, as people increasingly embrace cutting-edge technology, traditional paper documents such as newspapers and books may cease production due to the proliferation of online reading platforms. Individuals will have the opportunity to access a wide array of information without incurring any costs. I wholeheartedly concur with this assertion and believe that the benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks.\nFrom a general perspective, the rapid proliferation of gadgets in today's world has spurred technological advancements in the printing and publishing industry, leading to significant transformations.

      "paragraph": "In recent times, a growing number of city residents are choosing to reside in compact homes, primarily due to the increasing urban population. From my perspective, this trend brings about unfavorable consequences because it can give rise to various issues related to health and privacy.\nIt is undeniable that compact living spaces offer significant advantages for homeowners. These include time and cost savings on cleaning and maintenance, as well as reduced housing expenses. When living in limited quarters, individuals often find themselves making thoughtful decisions about what to keep, purchase, or discard. For example, living in close quarters encourages people to embrace a minimalist lifestyle, resulting in less time spent on cleaning and more financial resources available for essential services like healthcare and home upkeep. This is especially beneficial for those who live alone, operate on a tight budget, or have demanding work commitments.\nNevertheless, critics of this housing trend may argue that smaller living spaces are associated with health risks and privacy concerns. For instance, individuals who suffer from claustrophobia may experience significant mental distress when confined to a cramped space, negatively impacting their overall well-being. Conversely, larger or open living spaces with exposure to nature and sunlight can substantially improve one's mental health and provide greater convenience, as there is more room to arrange belongings. Furthermore, micro-housing is not suitable for larger families due to the lack of privacy it entails. Teenagers, who particularly value having their own spaces, are compelled to share their rooms with parents and siblings, leading to unwelcome discomfort and disputes among family members.\nTo sum up, living in a compact space does offer compelling advantages in terms of time and money savings. However, it is crucial to consider the potential health issues and overcrowding challenges it may pose. While some may find the simplicity of small living spaces appealing, it is essential to strike a balance between space-saving benefits and maintaining overall well-being and privacy.\n"

      "paragraph": "In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the amount of leftover food. This situation can be attributed to several factors and requires effective solutions. One primary factor is the marketing strategies used by restaurants, such as promotions like 'buy one, get one free' offers or large portion sizes, which encourage customers to purchase more food than they can actually eat. As a result, food often goes to waste because individuals cannot consume such a large amount. For example, Loteria, a well-known fast-food restaurant in Vietnam, is famous for its lunch combos, which may seem like a good deal as they are cheaper than ordering items separately. However, people often find themselves unable to finish the entire portion of food.\nAnother contributing factor is the quality of the food, including dishes that are overly spicy or excessively sweet, which can lead to food wastage. For instance, tourists exploring regions known for their spicy cuisine may struggle to eat local dishes, resulting in leftover food.\nSeveral solutions can be implemented to address this issue. Restaurants could impose fines on customers who leave unconsumed food, making them more aware of the amount of food they order. Dokki, a Korean food buffet restaurant in Vietnam, charges $5 for every 100 grams of leftovers, and since implementing this policy, there has been a significant reduction in food waste. Another approach could involve offering food samples in stores. This would help customers determine whether the food suits their preferences before making a purchase.\nIn conclusion, restaurants and stores contribute to food wastage due to their marketing strategies and the quality of their dishes, and corrective measures are necessary. In my opinion, customers should also take responsibility for the amount of food they order.\n"

      "paragraph": "Many individuals hold the belief that young people should adhere to the traditions of their society, while others argue that they should have the freedom to express themselves as individuals. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives and share my own viewpoint, taking various cultural and social factors into consideration.\nFirstly, there is a prevailing notion that embracing societal traditions, including customs and religions, is essential for the younger generation. Such adherence is seen as contributing significantly to the economy. Indeed, familiarity with these traditions can help young individuals expand their knowledge about their culture through regular interactions with them. Having a deep understanding of the moral and cultural values embedded in these traditions allows the younger generation to showcase their culture to the world, ultimately boosting tourism. Furthermore, this adherence helps in preserving cultural identities. By possessing extensive knowledge of their own traditions and customs, they can safeguard their cultures from external influences and claims of cultural appropriation. For instance, a controversy arose when the Chinese asserted that Kim Chi, a Korean traditional food, originated from China. Without a profound understanding of their own culture, the Korean people would be unable to effectively counter such claims and establish their ownership of Kim Chi.\nOn the other hand, advocating for the freedom of individual behavior can lead to a divergence from cultural norms and values. When young people are not constrained by societal standards, they have the liberty to make choices based on their own preferences. For example, in Chinese tradition, women are expected to wear Suon Xam, especially during significant events, as a sign of respect. Moreover, one's thought processes can be significantly influenced if they choose not to adhere to their cultural traditions. Some cultures have strict taboos on certain topics that are prohibited from discussion. China, for instance, has stringent taboos on sexuality, particularly regarding homosexuality. If these ideologies are deeply ingrained in the younger generation, it could result in restrictive stereotypes that hinder their open-mindedness.\nIn conclusion, there are valid arguments on both sides of this cultural and social spectrum. Many people may consider this issue to be neither entirely advantageous nor detrimental to the youth. However, in my view, young people should embrace the traditions of their society, as doing so brings benefits to their culture, society, and economy.\n"

In my view, while there are merits to being mentally strong, I believe that physical strength plays a more vital role in achieving success in sports.\nFirstly, physical strength is essential for success in all sports. This is because every sport has specific physical standards that athletes must meet to participate. Furthermore, most people who engage in sports aim to improve their physical fitness and overall well-being. In other words, individuals aspiring to succeed in sports must possess physical strength. For instance, sports such as judo and karate demand physical strength for stamina and endurance.\nOn the other hand, developing mental strength can assist athletes in overcoming setbacks and persevering in their training. Failures and disappointments are inevitable in sports, but mentally resilient athletes can navigate these challenges and continue their training. Tennis serves as an example of this. Tennis players must practice daily, often with repetitive and tedious drills. Nevertheless, determined tennis players endure such training to pursue future success. Although mental strength can provide a psychological boost to athletes, I view it as a supplementary factor that enhances performance rather than being the primary determinant.\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge that mental strength can help athletes overcome failures and maintain consistency in their training, I firmly believe that physical strength is the pivotal aspect necessary to achieve success in sports.\n"

      "paragraph": "The topic of whether lenient or strict parenting is better for children's overall development is highly debated today. Each approach has its own merits and drawbacks. In this essay, we will examine both the advantages and disadvantages of these parenting styles, and I will share my perspective.\nOn one hand, it is evident that children raised by strict parents can benefit greatly. Firstly, they are more likely to develop self-discipline and responsibility from a young age as they are expected to follow their parents' rules. For example, many families teach children to help with household chores or become independent early on, preparing them for the challenges they may face as they grow up. Furthermore, strict parents often set high expectations for their children's performance, motivating them to excel academically. Additionally, growing up in a strict family environment prioritizes the safety and well-being of the child, allowing them to focus on their studies without worrying about other concerns.\nHowever, strict parenting also comes with its downsides. Excessive rules and a lack of proper upbringing can lead to counterproductive outcomes, causing children to rebel against their parents. Some adolescents may feel the need to express their suppressed individuality, sometimes engaging with negative influences or neglecting their studies. Moreover, if parents place an excessive academic burden on their children, it can harm their motivation to learn and negatively impact their mental health. Therefore, the right approach to strict parenting is crucial to prevent these issues and ensure children's well-rounded development.\nOn the other hand, children raised by easy-going parents also experience several advantages. They are granted freedom from an early age, allowing them to develop valuable skills like self-confidence and independence. When faced with life's challenges, they are less likely to succumb to fear and may even thrive independently. Additionally, they do not face the pressure and anxiety that strict parenting can impose, as their parents have fewer expectations. Lastly, these children tend to have a strong bond of trust with their parents, enabling them to openly share their joys and sorrows without generation gaps interfering. Consequently, they are encouraged to pursue their interests and lead content lives.\nNonetheless, permissive parenting has its downsides. Children can become spoiled if their every request is fulfilled, and they may struggle to handle poor academic performance. Moreover, unless children receive thoughtful supervision and a well-rounded upbringing, they may display rudeness towards others, treating them as they would their parents or close friends. Thus, there is room for improvement in this style of parenting as well.\nIn conclusion, both strict and lenient parenting styles have their advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, I firmly believe that children can benefit immensely when parents harness the positive aspects of these styles while making efforts to mitigate their drawbacks.\n"

      "paragraph": "Education plays a crucial role in shaping individuals and guiding them towards their fullest potential. The question at hand revolves around the idea that universities should admit male and female students equally in all subjects. I hold a somewhat mixed perspective on this matter, leaning neither entirely toward agreement nor disagreement. While I believe that every individual should have equal access to education, it's essential to recognize that a university's primary mission is to prepare students to contribute effectively to society.\nIn accordance with the principles of human rights, both genders should unquestionably have the opportunity to pursue their preferred fields of study. In certain regions, cultural or social norms may hinder male doctors from specializing in gynecology, potentially leading to negative outcomes in women's healthcare. Given that both men and women contribute equally through taxation, it is only fair that they enjoy equitable educational opportunities. Moreover, when students compete in mixed-gender settings, they often face increased competition, which can foster improved communication skills and contribute to healthier relationships between genders. Ultimately, this can lead to fewer marital conflicts in the future and promote gender equality.\nFurthermore, this approach would empower women, especially in societies where they face disadvantages. By ensuring equal educational opportunities, women can acquire better skills and knowledge, ultimately benefiting their families, communities, and nations. Additionally, with a balanced gender distribution in various subjects, women can explore and excel in a broader range of research and employment fields, which would undoubtedly benefit the country as a whole. Importantly, reducing gender discrimination in classrooms is a significant step towards achieving this goal.\nHowever, it's crucial to acknowledge that some professions and study areas may be physically demanding and not suitable for everyone. For instance, certain fields, like construction engineering, may involve physically strenuous activities that could pose challenges for some women. Conversely, there are areas where women naturally excel, such as nursing, and these fields may warrant preferential treatment for female students.\nFinancial considerations also come into play. Implementing a strict gender equality policy may require universities to allocate larger budgets. Additionally, there is a concern that an enforced gender quota might inadvertently increase incidents of sexual violence on campuses.\nMoreover, reserving seats for females could potentially discriminate against highly talented male students. It is my belief that university admissions should primarily be based on individual talent and academic performance rather than enforcing gender parity.\nIn reality, striving for a strict 50-50 gender balance in all subjects may be impractical and could deny many talented male students access to higher education. It may lead to a natural selection process favoring the most capable individuals, which can ultimately benefit society as a whole.\nIn conclusion, while advocating for gender equality in education is important, we must consider the complexities of implementing such a policy. Balancing equal opportunities with individual aptitude and the unique demands of various fields is essential to ensure that education continues to serve its fundamental purpose - preparing students for a brighter future.\n"

Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognize that this growth may have adverse impacts on both cultures and the environment. I wholeheartedly agree with this perspective.\nTo begin with, the expansion of the tourism sector can yield economic gains for nations due to its attractiveness. With a wide array of stunning tourist destinations that capture visitors' attention, various regions can stimulate travelers to explore these areas. This, in turn, encourages tourists to spend their money on local services such as restaurants, hotels, and souvenirs, thereby bolstering economic prosperity. Furthermore, the growth in tourist attractions necessitates the employment of more individuals, creating job opportunities for local residents and contributing to economic development.\nHowever, the development of tourism industries can also bring about adverse consequences for the environment and local cultures, issues that are often overlooked. One significant concern associated with tourism is the lack of awareness among visitors regarding the importance of environmental preservation. Consequently, tourists may engage in improper activities such as littering, damaging natural habitats, and overusing resources. Unfortunately, local authorities may not impose strict penalties on visitors for such misconduct, as they aim to maintain a tourism-friendly image to encourage repeat visits and generate revenue for the local area. Additionally, the erosion of local traditions may not be perceived as a significant problem. Consequently, many local residents may adopt new cultures and traditions influenced by the diverse range of tourists, increasing the risk of cultural erosion.\nIn conclusion, while tourism can indeed generate substantial profits and create job opportunities for local residents, it can also lead to environmental degradation and cultural erosion.

      "paragraph": "In recent years, global air quality has been significantly impacted by pollution. While some individuals believe that the most effective approach to reducing air pollution is limiting the number of cars, others argue that there are alternative solutions to address this issue. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives before stating my opinion that restricting car ownership should be given top priority.\nIt is understandable why some people advocate for government control over the number of cars owned. The primary rationale supporting this viewpoint is that one of the main contributors to air pollution is the emission of greenhouse gases from car engines, such as CO2, NOx, and HC. This is especially noticeable in large cities where the number of cars has rapidly increased, resulting in consistently alarming levels of air pollution. Recent studies have indicated that the billions of tons of exhaust fumes released by vehicles annually contribute to climate change. Clearly, by limiting private car ownership and encouraging the general public to utilize public transportation or bicycles, we could swiftly improve air quality.\nOn the other hand, opponents argue that there are more effective methods for reducing air pollution, such as planting trees and controlling emissions from industrial factories. Undoubtedly, emissions have a detrimental impact on air quality. However, addressing this situation requires a long-term commitment and substantial financial investment, particularly for industries that may need to explore alternative energy sources like nuclear or renewables to replace fossil fuels. This transition would result in a reduction of greenhouse gases and emissions released into the atmosphere. Another approach supported by many is planting more trees to absorb greenhouse gases. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the efficiency of trees in absorbing emissions is relatively small compared to the volume emitted by vehicles. Additionally, tree planting demands a significant amount of time and incurs maintenance costs.\nIn conclusion, both sides of the argument have their merits.

Investing in national celebrations is worthwhile, and here are my reasons.\nFirstly, organizing national celebrations can foster a sense of amusement and unity. National holidays and festivals provide opportunities for people to come together and cultivate a sense of solidarity. These events help create a happy atmosphere in the community and also strengthen patriotism. For example, on National Independence Day, Americans hold parades and fireworks, while the Vietnamese government grants a nationwide day off. This provides an opportunity for people to come together and reunite while demonstrating love for their country.\nSecondly, national ceremonies typically draw a large number of tourists and patrons. This creates opportunities for local businesses such as hotels, restaurants, stores, and other travel services. Investing in these events can boost income and job opportunities for the younger generation. For instance, the Oktoberfest festival in Germany draws millions of visitors from across the globe. This is a great opportunity for local businesses to increase sales and attract visitors.\nNational celebrations and festivals frequently encapsulate a country's cultural values and traditions. Organizing and participating in these events contribute to the preservation and enrichment of a nation's distinctive culture. For example, the Lunar New Year festival in Vietnam is one of the most important festivals of the year. Traditional activities such as wishing for a Happy New Year, lighting firecrackers, and enjoying traditional dishes help maintain and develop Vietnamese culture.\nHowever, I think there is no need to spend excessive amounts of money on national celebrations and festivals that are unnecessary and wasteful. I believe these funds could be allocated to more pressing needs, such as enhancing infrastructure, education, or healthcare. Excessive expenditure on celebrations and festivals can also lead to social injustice and inequality.\nIn conclusion, spending money on national celebrations brings about many benefits for society, such as maintaining and preserving culture, developing the economy, and building a joyful and cohesive society.

In this essay, we will explore both the positive and negative aspects of globalization to determine whether it brings more benefits than drawbacks.\nOn the positive side, globalization has led to the rise of multinational corporations (MNCs). These companies, operating beyond national borders, have brought about economic growth and employment opportunities in many countries. The flow of money across borders has been relentless, injecting capital into local economies and facilitating international relations. Furthermore, MNCs often establish industrial parks, creating prospects for local businesses and fostering economic development.\nGlobalization can also be seen as a force for good in the realm of diplomacy. International relations have evolved, and countries are more interconnected than ever before. This interconnectedness has, in many instances, acted as a deterrent against conflict and has compelled nations to work together to address global issues. The notion of ousting a neighboring country or fostering resentment and distrust has become less appealing in a globalized world where cooperation is vital.\nHowever, it is essential to acknowledge that globalization has not been without its challenges. One major concern is environmental degradation. The pursuit of economic growth and industrialization has often come at the cost of the environment. This has raised questions about the sustainability of globalization and the need to compensate for the environmental damage caused.\nIn conclusion, while globalization has undeniable positive effects, it is not without its drawbacks. The expansion of multinational corporations and the improved international relations it fosters are significant benefits.

Given this situation, there are those who argue that it is the responsibility of governments to address this issue. I personally believe that the government, along with parents and schools, should all play a role in the effort to help children avoid such health problems.\nCertainly, the government should be held accountable for the increasing rates of childhood obesity and declining children's health. This is primarily because most governments have limited or no regulations in place to control the consumption of harmful food items like junk food and sugary drinks. These products have been scientifically proven to contribute to obesity. For instance, in Vietnam, the government even provided tax incentives to companies selling fast food, resulting in a significant increase in childhood obesity in the country. Moreover, valuable public spaces such as parks and squares, where children often engage in physical activities, are being replaced by high-rise apartments and other developments, largely due to government policies and inadequate oversight.\nWhile the role of governments in reducing childhood obesity is undeniable, parents and schools also bear a significant responsibility. Parents are the ones who determine what food their children consume and what activities they engage in. Therefore, if parents offer healthier food choices and encourage their children to participate in sports and outdoor activities, we can anticipate a decrease in the number of overweight and unhealthy children. Similarly, schools can organize more extracurricular activities that promote physical activity and educate students about the risks of leading a sedentary lifestyle and consuming unhealthy foods like fast food and sugary beverages.\nIn conclusion, as outlined above, all stakeholders, including the government, parents, and schools, should take responsibility for addressing the obesity epidemic among children.\n"

From my perspective, while children can indeed develop their language and personality before commencing school, receiving an education in school is the most effective way for them to engage with others and acquire academic knowledge necessary for a promising future.\nChildren have the opportunity to learn their native language and develop their personalities before they enter the formal school system. Most children receive their initial language instruction from their parents during their early years, which aids them in effectively interacting with teachers and peers once they begin attending school. During this phase, children's language skills, including vocabulary, pronunciation, and fluency, progress at a rapid pace because infants are adept at imitating those around them, especially their parents. Additionally, their personalities evolve gradually through interactions within their families. When children grow up alongside siblings, they learn valuable lessons in sharing and caring for their own flesh and blood. This not only strengthens familial bonds but also enhances their overall skill set.\nHowever, the experiences children gain before they embark on their school journey are insufficient to ensure a prosperous future. When children enter the school environment, they are exposed to a diverse range of individuals, and teachers impart essential academic knowledge that will significantly impact their future careers. Schooling plays a pivotal role in enhancing children's communication abilities, as they participate in various sports and teamwork activities that necessitate the expression of their thoughts and ideas to their peers.

In my view, I partially agree with this perspective.\nOn one hand, going abroad can be advantageous for various reasons. Firstly, foreign universities offer modern and advanced curricula, allowing undergraduates to acquire in-depth knowledge. Additionally, students may have opportunities to engage in group work activities, enabling them to acquire a wide range of skills that national universities may not provide. These skills include effectively handling challenging situations and fostering independent learning. Secondly, by forming new friendships with international peers and encouraging them to share insights into their cultures, students can expand their cultural awareness. For example, I once befriended a British classmate who introduced me to the delectable cuisine of the UK.\nOn the other hand, studying at home may offer certain advantages for those who opt to remain in their own countries. Firstly, students can adapt to their country's environment and seize opportunities for self-improvement. They can proactively seek information about companies they find appealing, which can pique the interest of potential employers. Moreover, in some fields such as medicine, law, and education, studying abroad can pose a disadvantage.

This requirement arises from the fact that these professions are typically regulated by national requirements, laws, and regulations. Consequently, studying in one's home country can enhance job prospects in many sectors.\nIn conclusion, while studying overseas broadens one's knowledge and global perspective, studying in one's home country enhances employability in specific domestic sectors. In my opinion, both options have their merits, and individuals should make their decisions based on their preferences and career aspirations.\n"

      "question": "Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the increasing presence of advertising, and explain why you believe the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.",
      "paragraph": "In today's world, advertising is an integral part of our daily lives. From my perspective, the increasing presence of advertising poses more challenges than advantages, often leading to consumer skepticism and a dislike for advertisements among the general public.\nOn one hand, the widespread use of advertising offers significant advantages to both businesses and consumers. Firstly, promotional campaigns can greatly benefit businesses by boosting sales and revenues. Moreover, advertisements make it possible for a wider audience to discover specific products, driving increased demand. This, in turn, enables businesses to expand their production capabilities, leverage economies of scale, and reduce production costs. These factors provide a competitive edge, helping them stand out in crowded markets. Additionally, through advertising, companies can gather valuable feedback from consumers about product quality, design, and areas for improvement. This feedback is instrumental in maintaining and enhancing product quality, ultimately building a reputable brand and fostering consumer trust.\nHowever, I hold the belief that excessive exposure to advertisements can have unintended consequences, rendering it counterproductive and annoying. Firstly, the constant bombardment of similar advertisements can make consumers wary of a product's authenticity, making it challenging to distinguish genuine offerings. Furthermore, the saturation of advertisements breeds a sense of aversion among people. Consequently, individuals may actively seek ways to avoid exposure to advertisements whenever possible, such as turning to ad-blockers or opting for premium subscription services that promise an ad-free experience.\nIn conclusion, while advertising offers substantial benefits to businesses and consumers in terms of production efficiencies, pricing, and product quality, its drawbacks are more prominent as it can irritate consumers and deter them from engaging with advertised products.\n"

      "paragraph": "Traditional celebrations may no longer be as familiar to people as they once were, but they still hold significant meaning. I believe that allocating funds for national celebrations is indeed a worthwhile endeavor. Here are my reasons:\nFirstly, organizing national celebrations can foster unity and create a sense of enjoyment. National holidays and festivals provide opportunities for people to come together and cultivate a spirit of solidarity. These events contribute to a joyful atmosphere within the community, reinforcing their love for the homeland. For instance, every National Day, Americans host parades and fireworks to commemorate National Independence Day, while the Vietnamese government grants a day off to people across the country, allowing them to come together and reconnect. This not only promotes unity but also displays love for the nation.\nSecondly, national ceremonies typically attract a considerable number of visitors and customers. This, in turn, benefits local businesses such as hotels, restaurants, stores, and other travel services. Investing in these events can boost income and create job opportunities, particularly for young people. Consider the Oktoberfest festival in Germany, which draws millions of visitors from around the world. This presents a significant chance for local businesses to enhance their sales and attract tourists.\nNational celebrations and festivals also carry the cultural values and traditions of a country. Engaging in and organizing these events play a pivotal role in preserving and nurturing a nation's unique culture. For instance, the Lunar New Year festival in Vietnam stands as one of the most vital festivals of the year. Embracing traditional activities like New Year well-wishing, lighting firecrackers, and savoring traditional dishes contributes to the preservation and growth of Vietnamese culture.\nNevertheless, I hold the opinion that there is no need to allocate excessive funds to unnecessary and extravagant national celebrations and festivals. Instead, these resources could be better utilized for more critical purposes such as improving infrastructure, education, or healthcare. Overspending on celebrations and festivals may also contribute to societal injustice and inequality.\nIn conclusion, investing in national celebrations offers numerous advantages to society, including the preservation of culture, economic development, and the promotion of a joyful and harmonious community. However, it is crucial to strike a balance and avoid extravagant spending on such events, redirecting resources toward pressing societal needs.\n"

      "paragraph": "Money has long been recognized as an essential aspect of people's lives, contributing to a more fulfilling existence. Therefore, many argue that individuals work diligently to secure better financial prospects. However, I respectfully disagree with this perspective, and I will explain my reasons below.\nOne significant reason why people do not solely prioritize monetary gain when choosing their careers is that working without passion and dedication often leads to unproductive jobs. When individuals are passionate about their work, they tend to be more productive, dedicated, and efficient. This heightened performance can open up opportunities for advancement and promotion. Furthermore, some individuals opt for careers that align with their natural strengths and talents.\nTo address the issue of declining bicycle usage, several possible measures can be considered. Firstly, the government could impose higher taxes on alternative modes of transportation. Such taxes would discourage people from using vehicles and, in turn, promote bicycle usage. Additionally, it is imperative for the government to allocate more funds for planning and constructing dedicated cycling lanes for residents. This approach not only alleviates traffic congestion during peak hours but also enhances safety for cyclists.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the lack of convenience and dedicated cycling infrastructure in some countries are the primary reasons behind the unpopularity of bicycles. This negative trend can be effectively addressed through the implementation of a new tax on motor vehicles and the creation of dedicated cycling lanes for bike riders.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's world, there is no denying that the tourism industry has experienced significant growth, leading to substantial economic gains for many nations. However, it is crucial to recognize that this growth can have negative impacts on both cultures and the environment. I wholeheartedly agree with this perspective.\nTo begin with, tourism can be a lucrative source of income for countries due to its appealing attractions. Regions that offer diverse and prominent tourist destinations can capture the interest of travelers, inspiring them to explore these areas. This, in turn, encourages tourists to spend their money on local services like restaurants, hotels, and souvenirs, ultimately boosting economic prosperity. Furthermore, as tourist-related services expand, numerous businesses require a larger workforce, leading to increased job opportunities for local residents and overall economic development.\nNevertheless, the expansion of the tourism industry can have detrimental effects on the environment and local culture, often overlooked by many. A significant concern with tourism is the lack of awareness among visitors about the importance of preserving the environment. Consequently, tourists engage in improper activities such as littering, damaging natural habitats, and overusing resources. Unfortunately, local authorities may not impose strict penalties on these actions to maintain a tourist-friendly image and encourage repeat visits, which generates revenue for the local area. Additionally, the erosion of local traditions is not always recognized as a pressing issue. Consequently, many local residents may adopt new customs and traditions from a wide range of tourists, increasing the risk of cultural erosion.\nIn conclusion, while tourism can indeed generate substantial profits and create job opportunities for local communities, it can also contribute to environmental degradation and cultural erosion. This is often due to the authorities' desire for financial gain and a lack of appreciation for the importance of preserving culture and the environment.\n"

While I agree that certain ideas from older individuals may appear outdated, I disagree with the notion of dismissing all of them, as many conventional viewpoints remain pertinent and applicable in today's world.\nOn one hand, there are traditional notions from older generations that may not align with the preferences of the younger generation. For instance, previous generations frequently advised their children to pursue stable, lifelong careers. However, in today's world, young people tend to chase their dreams and passions, frequently exploring various job opportunities. Furthermore, contemporary youth often hold progressive views on gender roles within families, diminishing the significance of traditional distinctions between housewives and breadwinners, as they share responsibilities equally.\nOn the other hand, some traditional perspectives of our ancestors still hold value and relevance. For example, older generations tend to prioritize hard work, striving for excellence, and taking pride in one's professional endeavors. These qualities remain crucial in today's competitive work environment. Additionally, older generations place a strong emphasis on politeness and good manners when interacting with others. In contrast, modern youth can sometimes exhibit materialistic and self-centered tendencies, while our predecessors imparted valuable lessons on how to foster positive relationships within families and communities.\nIn conclusion, while our forefathers may maintain conventional views on certain aspects of life, I believe that some of these ideas still possess merit and should not be entirely dismissed.\n"

      "paragraph": "With the increasing average life expectancy, individuals find themselves compelled to extend their working years to secure their retirement. One proposed solution is for people to commence their careers at a younger age. This essay will examine whether this alternative is beneficial or detrimental.\nCommencing employment at an earlier age can provide several advantages. Firstly, it enables individuals to accumulate valuable work experience and develop skills essential for their careers. Younger individuals tend to be more adaptable and quick learners, facilitating their integration into the workforce. Moreover, initiating work early naturally extends the duration of their working years, aiding in the accumulation of sufficient financial resources for a lengthier retirement. Additionally, a younger workforce can infuse industries with enthusiasm and innovation, fostering economic growth.\nNonetheless, entering the workforce at a younger age also presents challenges. Firstly, it may disrupt individuals' educational journeys, compelling them to make sacrifices such as forgoing higher education or specialized training in favor of immediate employment. This could potentially constrain their long-term career prospects and earning potential. Furthermore, young people might lack the emotional or psychological maturity required to cope with job-related stress and responsibilities, potentially leading to burnout or mental health issues. From a broader perspective, a surge in young workers might exacerbate unemployment rates among older individuals, as employers might opt for cheaper and more adaptable young workers over experienced ones.\nIn conclusion, initiating one's career at a younger age has its merits and drawbacks. While it can alleviate the challenges posed by longer retirement periods and bring new perspectives to the job market, it may hinder educational opportunities and negatively impact mental well-being, potentially affecting society as a whole. A balanced approach could involve flexible educational programs that allow young people to gain work experience while continuing their academic growth. By seeking middle-ground solutions like this, society can prepare itself for the challenges arising from increased life expectancy without unduly burdening its younger members.\n"

      "paragraph": "Some individuals argue that the experiences children have before they start school have a more significant impact on their future lives than those gained during their teenage years. From my perspective, while children can develop their language and personality before attending school, studying in school is the best way for them to interact with others and acquire academic knowledge for a brighter future.\nChildren can learn their mother tongue and develop their personalities before they start school. Most children are taught their first language by their parents during their early years, and this can help them interact with teachers and friends when they enter school. During this period, children's language abilities, including vocabulary, pronunciation, and fluency, improve rapidly because infants have the ability to imitate others, especially their parents. Moreover, their personalities gradually take shape through their interactions with siblings and parents. When children live with their siblings, they learn how to share and care for their own flesh and blood, strengthening family bonds and enhancing their overall skills.\nHowever, the experiences children gain before they begin school are not sufficient for a better future. When kids go to school, they have the opportunity to communicate with a variety of people, and teachers impart academic knowledge that will significantly impact their future careers. School provides a platform for children to enhance their communication abilities through participation in various sports and teamwork activities, which require them to express their opinions to their peers. This not only improves their communication skills but also boosts their self-esteem. Furthermore, school is an ideal place for children to acquire knowledge relevant to their future careers because there are several teachers with high academic qualifications who can provide them with appropriate guidance.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that although children can learn invaluable life lessons and practical skills such as their mother tongue and supporting their siblings while at home, these experiences are insufficient. To ensure a better future, they must attend school to gain a deeper understanding of academic knowledge and develop essential communication skills.\n"

      "paragraph": "There is an ongoing debate about the acceptability of using animals in medical research for the benefit of humans, with some people arguing in favor of it, while others oppose it. In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide my opinion.\nOn one hand, there are valid reasons why some people support the use of animals in pharmaceutical research. Firstly, it is seen as a cost-effective approach. Using animals for experiments is generally less expensive than conducting experiments that require expensive resources. For example, the overall costs of using white mice for medical examinations are almost half of those using chemical and natural resources. Secondly, using animals in experiments can enhance human safety. This is because testing medical products on animals in advance helps identify potential reactions they may cause in humans. It can also serve as a safer alternative to conducting experiments directly on humans, which could lead to anxiety or even death. For instance, many beauty and cosmetic products are tested on suitable animal species like white mice, horses, and occasionally rabbits to ensure their safety for human use. Without these tests, there could be more instances of harmful products reaching consumers.\nOn the other hand, conducting medical research on endangered species can have negative consequences for biodiversity. Endangered species play a crucial role in diversifying wildlife, and subjecting them to risky experiments can threaten their survival. In the past, the development of medicines led to the near-extinction of many species due to unawareness. Additionally, some researchers have been criticized for conducting unethical tests on animals, which can have harmful effects on their genetic makeup and overall biology. For example, experimenting with certain chemical substances to enhance human strength on specific horse breeds has been deemed unethical and harmful to their genetic integrity, leading to negative health outcomes.\nIn conclusion, while using animals for medical research can be cost-effective and enhance human safety by reducing the risk of harm, it can also have adverse effects on biodiversity and be inhumane when conducted on endangered species or when it results in harmful genetic modifications. It is essential to strike a balance between the benefits of medical research and the ethical treatment of animals to ensure a more responsible approach to this issue.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's modern society, many individuals tend to assess a person based on their social status and wealth. Unfortunately, traditional values like honor, kindness, and trust are often overlooked. I strongly agree with the notion that people frequently judge others solely on their outward appearances, and I will elaborate on the reasons for my stance.\nTo begin with, the rise of social media has led to the widespread popularity of individuals, particularly artists and celebrities. Many young people become fans of these figures simply because they are attractive and glamorous. Consequently, people tend to prioritize physical beauty, and those artists who are more aesthetically pleasing attract a larger following.\nFurthermore, individuals with substantial wealth often enjoy more extensive social networks. It can be said that having significant material possessions leads to numerous friendships. In other words, being affluent can bring various benefits, such as the opportunity to go shopping without worrying about expenses or securing job opportunities without having to submit applications.\nRegrettably, it appears that many now evaluate a person primarily based on their external attributes. As a result, traditional values like kindness, honor, and, most notably, trust, have been pushed into the background. Social status and material wealth have become the predominant criteria for judging individuals.\nIn conclusion, the reasons I have outlined in this essay reinforce my strong agreement with the opinion presented earlier. It is imperative that we shift our focus away from superficial appearances and prioritize a person's inner qualities.\n"

In my opinion, both perspectives have valid reasons, which I will discuss in this essay.\nOn one hand, it is understandable why some people view using animals for pharmaceutical research as acceptable. Firstly, this approach to experimentation can be cost-effective. Clearly, conducting experiments on animals is less expensive than using essential resources, which are more valuable in other areas. For example, it is undeniable that the overall costs of using white mice for medical tests are almost half of those incurred when using chemical and natural resources. Secondly, conducting experiments on animals ensures the safety of humans. This is because testing medical products on animals in advance can reveal potential reactions that could affect human well-being.

For instance, most pre-market shampoos and cosmetics are tested on suitable animal species like white mice, horses, and occasionally rabbits, demonstrating their safety for humans. Without these advanced tests on animals, there would be more cases of malfunctioning products.\nOn the other hand, conducting medical research on endangered species can negatively impact biodiversity conservation efforts. This is because these animals play a vital role in diversifying wildlife, which is already vulnerable and requires suitable habitats for survival and reproduction. Instead of being used in risky medical experiments, these species should be protected and allowed to contribute to maintaining healthy populations. For example, in the past, due to human ignorance, many endangered species were pushed to the brink of extinction for the purpose of medical testing. Furthermore, some researchers engage in inhumane practices, conducting unethical tests on animals. Clearly, such strategies can have detrimental effects on animals, altering their genetic makeup and causing other biological harm. To illustrate, using certain chemical substances to enhance human strength on a specific breed of horses was deemed immoral because it harmed the genetic structure of the species, leading to negative physical health outcomes.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that using appropriate animals for medical research can be cost-effective and reduce risks to humans, it can also have adverse effects on biodiversity and result in cruel treatment of threatened species or harmful modifications to their genetic makeup.\n"

Some argue that structured activities are beneficial for kids' development, while others believe that allowing children to choose their free-time pursuits promotes their independence and natural talents. In my opinion, a balanced approach is the most effective strategy.\nOn one hand, parents, with their years of experience and access to a wealth of information, can provide their children with suitable leisure activities. They can gain insights from various parenting courses and online forums, where they can learn about the educational benefits of certain recreational activities, along with practical ways to organize them. These resources also offer numerous recommendations for productive children's activities. For example, parents can establish a weekly family game night, where they play board games or engage in other group activities that enhance their children's social and cognitive skills.\nOn the other hand, granting children the freedom to choose their pastimes can be advantageous in nurturing their unique talents. When children have the freedom to select their leisure activities, they have ample opportunities to explore their interests and discover new hobbies. This exploration can work wonders for their creativity, imagination, and independence. For instance, a child who is passionate about sports may actively seek out a park, interact with like-minded individuals, and join a sports team. This not only benefits their physical fitness but also enhances their teamwork and communication skills. Moreover, when children are free to make choices during their leisure time, they tend to take ownership of their decisions. This, in turn, improves their decision-making skills and capacity for self-reliance, both of which play crucial roles in their personal growth and future prospects.\nIn conclusion, both viewpoints have their merits and can have positive effects on children's development.

      "paragraph": "In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the consumption of fast food worldwide, resulting in various health problems associated with this type of food. Some individuals argue that governments should introduce new regulations imposing higher taxes on fast food. From my perspective, I strongly agree with this viewpoint for the following reasons.\nFirstly, fast food has adverse effects on human health. The primary reason people turn to fast food on a daily basis is their lack of time to cook and prepare meals for their families. Due to the rapid pace of global development, individuals are dedicating more time to work, meeting deadlines, and boosting their companies' economies. They often start their workdays early in the morning and frequently work overtime, leaving them with insufficient time to cook at home. Consequently, they opt to stop by fast-food restaurants conveniently located on their commute home to purchase meals. They then spend the remainder of the day relaxing and tending to their well-being. Excessive consumption of fast food can lead to serious health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, and respiratory problems. One of the critical components in fast food is oil, which is detrimental to the body. It serves to enhance the aroma and taste of the food.\nSecondly, the implementation of this rule would incentivize fast food establishments to enhance the quality of their products. It is widely recognized that not all food providers prioritize producing high-quality food for ordinary citizens. Even some renowned brands fail to deliver products that meet established standards. Moreover, the imposition of higher taxes on fast food could dissuade consumers from indulging due to the resulting higher prices. As taxes increase, so do food prices. Consequently, when governments raise taxes on fast food, it contributes to the country's economic growth. For instance, with a substantial budget, governments can invest in improving the nation's infrastructure and amenities, elevating the overall living standards of the people. Governments can also provide financial support to citizens in need, offering them an opportunity to rebuild their lives.\nIn conclusion, the aforementioned reasons provide strong grounds for my belief that imposing higher taxes on fast food is an urgent measure that governments should implement.\n"

By launching rockets or satellites to explore the stars and outer space, a nation can showcase its advanced technology, which can be enticing for people considering immigration for study or work. Additionally, the process of developing rockets or satellites can lead to breakthroughs in various fields. For example, the United States and India have pioneered orbit satellites that provide free access to communication and the internet for all citizens, even those in remote or hazardous areas, facilitating the smooth flow of information.\nOn the other hand, space exploration can pose a challenge for many developing countries that lack the technological and infrastructural capacity to develop spaceships. This can become a financial burden without substantial benefits for the citizens. Consider India, for instance, which successfully launched a rocket to the Moon. Despite this achievement, millions of people in remote areas continue to live in poverty and homelessness, experiencing little improvement in their quality of life. Therefore, redirecting investment from space exploration to addressing citizens' financial struggles may be a more prudent choice for such nations.\nIn conclusion, while space exploration offers numerous advantages to governments, it is crucial for every country to carefully assess its own circumstances before embarking on such endeavors.

In my view, I believe that individuals bear the responsibility for addressing this issue.\nOn one hand, some contend that environmental problems are of global concern and that governments should take the lead in addressing them. They have the ability to create awareness programs to educate the public about being environmentally conscious. For instance, governments can educate the public about the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions and promote the use of public transportation, such as buses and trains, instead of personal vehicles, which contribute to air pollution. By reducing the number of cars on the road, the air quality can be improved. Additionally, governments should establish rules and sanctions to encourage people to protect the environment and reduce factors contributing to global issues.\nOn the other hand, it is widely believed that individuals are responsible for mitigating environmental problems, and I concur with this perspective. In contemporary society, people often do not take environmental issues seriously. Failure to take action will only exacerbate the situation. Therefore, communities have a crucial role to play. For example, individuals can start recycling or switch to biodegradable packaging instead of plastic bags. Another reason for individual responsibility is that some prioritize financial gain over environmental conservation, leading them to indiscriminately cut down trees for construction or profit.\nIn conclusion, while opinions may differ, I firmly believe that each individual plays a significant role in preserving the environment.

This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this growing trend.\nOn the positive side, mobile phones offer several clear benefits. Firstly, they can assist people with various day-to-day tasks. Thanks to advanced technology, mobile phones can serve as alarm clocks to wake people up in the morning. They also provide the convenience of listening to music, browsing the Internet, making video calls, and watching films without any difficulties. For example, students find smartphones invaluable for taking quick notes or recording lessons, giving them more opportunities to review their teachers' instructions. It is especially beneficial for economically disadvantaged students who may not have the opportunity to attend school in person. Learning online with their phones allows them to bridge the gap between themselves and other students. Secondly, having a mobile phone on hand can be essential in emergencies. For instance, when someone is lost and unsure of their location, they can contact their family for assistance or use Google Maps to find the best route. People living far from their relatives can use these devices to stay connected and monitor their well-being and daily routines.\nOn the other hand, there are also several drawbacks to excessive mobile phone usage. Foremost among them is the negative impact on interpersonal relationships. For instance, when a family goes out to a restaurant, they often spend more time glued to their smartphone screens than engaging in face-to-face conversation about their day. While using these technologies to contact others is not inherently inappropriate, it often comes at the expense of in-person communication. This can strain family relationships and indirectly reduce people's ability to interact face-to-face effectively.

Consequently, online education serves as a valuable resource for students to clarify misunderstandings and satiate their curiosity about various subjects. Additionally, online learning offers the convenience of studying without the pressure of punctuality, alleviating the need for parents to rush their children to school or address transportation issues.\nOn the flip side, online education presents its own set of drawbacks. One notable disadvantage is the absence of face-to-face interaction between students and their teachers. Teachers may struggle to monitor students' activities effectively during lessons. Students can employ tactics to divert their attention, such as using their phones for personal activities. Furthermore, students themselves may resort to technology to cheat on exams, exploiting the limited oversight due to restrictions on surveillance and students' integrity.\nIn conclusion, online learning offers numerous advantages, such as time-saving and easy access to valuable information related to lessons. However, it also harbors several disadvantages, including the lack of in-person interaction and the potential for academic dishonesty. Despite these drawbacks, the merits of online education outweigh its disadvantages. Nevertheless, it is crucial for students to use this resource responsibly and maintain their integrity to fully reap its benefits.\n"

      "question": "Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of using additives in the food industry, and explain why you believe the risks outweigh the benefits.",
      "paragraph": "The use of additives in the food industry has grown significantly in recent years, primarily for storage purposes and to enhance taste. In my view, this manufacturing approach may pose more risks to consumers than its associated benefits.\nThere are several reasons for incorporating additional substances into mass-produced food and beverages. Undoubtedly, various chemicals play a crucial role in extending the shelf life of edible products, which is convenient for manufacturers. Additionally, since food and beverages need to be visually appealing and flavorful to attract consumers, chemicals and additives are essential to meet these preferences. Some specialized chemicals can also expedite the food production process. Therefore, adding supplementary components offers several advantages, including time and cost efficiency, as products have a longer shelf life and can reach a larger customer base.\nHowever, while acknowledging the positive impacts of preservatives and other chemicals in manufacturing, there are numerous drawbacks to consider. In reality, this production strategy primarily benefits business owners, while consumers may be at risk of hidden health hazards, increasing the likelihood of developing chronic diseases. Despite the positive messages conveyed through media coverage, the presence of unverified elements in food and beverages remains a persistent issue due to the lack of regular inspections. For example, many well-known corporations have been reported to include toxic ingredients in their products to prolong shelf life or enhance taste, regardless of their detrimental effects on consumers. Some studies have also shown a connection between certain food additives and hyperactivity in children, which is a concern for parents.\nIn conclusion, despite the many benefits that preservatives and chemicals bring to the food industry, they fail to ensure the long-term physical well-being of consumers. Authorities are essential in proposing policies to counter this trend and promote the availability of organic alternatives.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's world, we are witnessing a dwindling number of students opting for science subjects at the university level across many nations. This issue raises several concerns for society.\nOne primary reason behind this phenomenon could be the perceived difficulty of acquiring knowledge in science subjects, especially during one's university years. The challenging nature of these subjects often leads to feelings of monotony and stress during lectures, causing some students to lose motivation and give up on their studies if they lack the necessary perseverance. In contrast, social science subjects are perceived as easier to excel in, which can lead students to believe that they can secure higher grades and ultimately a better job with a social science degree.\nThis trend has significant implications for society. Firstly, it affects the teaching profession. As students lose interest in science subjects, a decline in passion among teachers becomes evident, starting as early as high school. This lack of enthusiasm can result in reduced science knowledge and lower academic performance. Furthermore, the decreasing number of students choosing science subjects may jeopardize the job security of science teachers in the future. Another critical aspect to consider is the shortage of professionals in the field of science. The growth of the economy relies heavily on individuals with strong skills and knowledge in STEM-related areas. If students continue to favor social science subjects over natural science subjects, it will undoubtedly have a significant and detrimental impact on the country's economic development.\nIn conclusion, the reasons behind the declining interest in science subjects are apparent.

      "paragraph": "There is a contentious issue regarding whether newly constructed houses should closely resemble the architectural style of old houses in local areas, or whether individuals should have the freedom to design their houses according to their preferences. In my view, I strongly believe that people should be allowed to design their own houses for suitable reasons.\nFirstly, one of the primary reasons for constructing houses and buildings in specific areas with a similar style is to preserve traditional and cultural values. Take, for instance, Hoi An, the ancient city in Vietnam renowned for preserving the traditions of past empires and leveraging them to attract tourists from around the world. It is evident how modern lifestyles and cultural aspects seamlessly blend in Hoi An, where not only residential properties but also business establishments, such as Highland Coffee and Starbucks, are required to replicate the ancient architectural style of the area. The strict adherence to this architectural style in Hoi An significantly contributes to preserving the city's identity and effectively boosting the tourism industry as well as the local economy.\nOn the other hand, people should have the right to design and build houses that meet their needs and financial capabilities. Traditional house designs could lead to inconveniences for residents, as they may fail to satisfy both utility and the aesthetic preferences of the homeowners. For instance, some single-storey houses situated on ancient streets in Ha Noi are not allowed to undergo renovations, resulting in multi-generational households living in discomfort. Moreover, it is unreasonable for the government to compel people to conform to architectural styles that do not align with their desires. Residing in an environment that suits their preferences can play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life for citizens.\nIn conclusion, while there are valid reasons for advocating the replication of the architectural style of old houses in newly constructed buildings, I firmly believe that individuals should have the freedom to design their houses to cater to their own needs and comfort.\n"

While the personal nature of happiness makes it hard to describe, it seems to have some common needs that we all share related to experiencing or achieving happiness.\nThe definition of happiness is not easy because it is created personally and flexibly. No one can fully understand or experience others' feelings, and each of us has our own passions that bring us pleasure. Some individuals, for instance, derive a sense of satisfaction from earning money or achieving success, while others treasure health and family much more. The various emotions associated with the idea of happiness include numerous levels and types. Therefore, for the same events, every individual has different emotions depending on times, places, status, mood, or even weather.\nAlthough it seems almost impractical to provide precise explanations of happiness, most individuals agree on some common points of view about happiness and how to attain it. Firstly, we cannot be truly happy without safe accommodation or enough food to satisfy our hunger. Our basic survival needs must be met before we can experience the positive emotions associated with happiness. Secondly, the greatest pleasure in life is found in sharing life with family, friends, and other relationships. Other elements that contribute to happiness could include personal freedom and an understanding of life's purpose.\nIn conclusion, defining happiness is challenging due to its personal nature.

      "paragraph": "In today's world, there is a noticeable rise in antisocial behavior, including criminal activities, among individuals. This growing trend can be attributed to various factors, and addressing this issue requires considering several solutions.\nTo begin with, one primary factor contributing to this problem is a lack of education. Individuals who are not fully aware of the consequences of their actions are more likely to engage in inappropriate behaviors, including criminal activities. For example, children in rural areas where education is undervalued may display more aggressive behavior compared to their peers who regularly attend school. Additionally, antisocial behavior can manifest in children whose parents are preoccupied with their work. In our fast-paced society, many parents are deeply engrossed in their jobs and often neglect to monitor their children's online activities. Consequently, many children have unrestricted access to online content, particularly violent movies. As a result, a significant number of young individuals mimic these violent elements and incorporate them into their real lives.\nFurthermore, there are several potential actions that can help alleviate the severity of this prevalent issue. At the national level, a prominent solution is to enhance the quality of education across all regions of a country. To achieve this, it is crucial for both citizens and lawmakers to take responsibility for their actions. Together, they can advocate for improved education to reduce crime and violence rates. Moreover, within the family unit, parents should recognize the importance of providing guidance to their children. For instance, they can educate their children on how to distinguish between the positive and negative aspects of online content. This seemingly small action can have a significant impact on young children.\nIn conclusion, the lack of access to quality education and inadequate adult supervision are major factors contributing to individuals' antisocial behavior.

While I concur with this viewpoint, this essay will elucidate the kinds of punishment that both parents and teachers should consider employing to instill good behavior in children.\nOn one hand, it is indeed beneficial for youngsters to develop an understanding of right and wrong at an early age due to several advantages. Firstly, children and pre-adolescents are at an age when they require guidance in shaping their own personalities. Gaining awareness of right and wrong during their formative years helps them avoid future confusion when confronted with moral dilemmas. Moreover, discerning the distinction between right and wrong contributes to instilling a sense of rationality in children. If they learn how to make sound decisions, they are more likely to exhibit maturity instead of succumbing to irrational thoughts and actions. Furthermore, when children make mistakes, it is appropriate to implement punitive measures that serve as deterrents. These measures assist them in assessing the righteousness of their actions and deter them from repeating their errors.\nOn the other hand, adults, including parents and teachers, should focus on employing educational punishments that are moderate in nature to guide children's behavior. One common disciplinary action is assigning children household chores as a form of punishment. This penalty not only necessitates them to invest their time in supporting their family but also encourages them to make amends for their transgressions. Additionally, some parents may require their children to read a book related to moral education and extract meaningful lessons or quotations from it. This approach not only obliges children to shoulder responsibility but also imparts valuable knowledge that will benefit them in life. Lastly, it can be constructive to temporarily restrict children from their favorite possessions, such as toys, smartphones, or computers, as a consequence of their misbehavior. Clearly, this encourages them to allocate their time to constructive activities in order to compensate for their wrongdoings.\nIn conclusion, our primary focus should be on assisting children in distinguishing between right and wrong through appropriate forms of punishment that facilitate their learning. Moreover, we should emphasize the use of educational punishments to cultivate their good behavior.\n"

Some argue that this practice benefits the economy, while others believe it can harm society. Although the former viewpoint has its merits, I tend to favor the latter perspective.\nOn one hand, boosting consumer spending can positively affect the overall economy. For example, when consumers purchase more goods, companies earn higher profits, which, in turn, can lead to business growth and expansion. Consequently, this increased demand for goods and services can help address unemployment issues by creating more job opportunities. Moreover, governments can benefit from higher consumer spending by collecting increased tax revenue. This extra revenue can be invested in essential public services such as transportation and internet infrastructure.\nOn the other hand, encouraging excessive consumption can have adverse effects on both individuals and the environment.

      "paragraph": "In recent years, there has been a surge in the number of people worldwide consuming fast food, leading to several associated health problems. Some individuals argue that it is necessary for governments to introduce new regulations imposing higher taxes on fast food. From my perspective, I firmly agree with this statement for the following reasons.\nFirstly, fast food has a detrimental impact on human health. The primary reason people turn to fast food on a daily basis is their lack of time to cook and prepare meals for their families. As the world develops, people find themselves spending more time at work to meet deadlines and contribute to their companies' economies. They often need to start their workday early and frequently work overtime, leaving them with insufficient time to cook at home. Consequently, they opt to visit fast-food restaurants conveniently located on their way home to purchase meals, thus allocating the rest of their day for relaxation and self-care. The excessive consumption of fast food can result in severe health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and respiratory issues. Notably, one of the most harmful components of this food is oil, which serves to enhance the food's aroma and flavor.\nSecondly, implementing this regulation will incentivize fast food establishments to enhance the quality of their products. It is widely acknowledged that not all food retailers prioritize providing high-quality food for the general public. Some renowned brands still fail to offer products that meet the required standards. Moreover, an increase in tax on fast food can discourage consumers due to the resulting higher prices. The elevated tax will naturally lead to an increase in the cost of fast food items. When governments raise taxes on fast food, it contributes to the country's economic growth. For instance, with a larger budget, governments can invest in the development of national infrastructure and amenities to elevate the living standards of their citizens. Governments can also provide financial assistance to individuals with limited financial resources, offering them opportunities to improve their quality of life.\nIn conclusion, the aforementioned reasons provide substantial grounds for my belief that imposing higher taxes on fast food is a crucial measure that governments should adopt.\n"

I wholeheartedly concur with this notion and advocate for the exploration of alternative methods of aid for impoverished countries.\nFirst and foremost, numerous factors can plunge a country into financial hardship. Conflict stands out as a primary cause, wreaking havoc on a nation's economy and infrastructure. Simply providing monetary assistance does not directly address these underlying issues. Likewise, natural disasters, beyond a country's control, can inflict recurrent devastation, necessitating expert assistance and advanced equipment for better preparedness.\nFurthermore, rampant corruption can single-handedly drain a nation's resources, compounding the problems mentioned above.

Moreover, online courses require high levels of self-discipline and motivation since learners must effectively manage their time and avoid distractions. Another concern is the potential for technological issues, such as poor internet connectivity or computer malfunctions, which can disrupt the learning process.\nIn my perspective, online education serves as a valuable addition to the educational landscape, but it should not completely replace traditional classroom-based learning. A balanced approach that incorporates both methods can harness the benefits of accessibility, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness from online education while preserving the advantages of in-person interaction and structured learning found in traditional classrooms.\nIn conclusion, online education offers numerous advantages, such as accessibility and flexibility, but it also comes with disadvantages related to interaction and self-discipline. Achieving a balance between online and traditional education is essential for maximizing the benefits of both approaches.\n"

      "paragraph": "In various nations, there is a gradual increase in the elderly population. I personally believe that this trend can have more adverse effects on society, primarily in terms of workforce scarcity and the rising costs of welfare.\nOne significant issue that can arise from a high percentage of elderly individuals in a country is the shortage of workers. Many companies tend to avoid hiring older individuals because they are more likely to experience health problems such as Alzheimer's or strokes. These health issues can hinder the older workforce's performance and productivity, leading to a decline in the company's revenue. In contrast, younger individuals generally enjoy better health and can adapt to new advanced technologies more quickly, making them better suited for the current job market demands. Consequently, as the number of elderly people increases in some countries, there might be a shortage of available workers.\nThe second issue stemming from the growing elderly population is the escalating cost of social welfare. Due to the increased demand for welfare, particularly healthcare services, governments must invest more in infrastructure development, such as hospitals and retirement homes. Furthermore, both governmental bodies and private organizations have to allocate significant funds to cover retirement pensions. Consequently, the high percentage of elderly people can put additional strain on the national budget.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the steadily rising number of elderly people can bring about more negative effects on society, including a scarcity of workers and higher expenditures on social welfare.\n"

      "paragraph": "While the idea of public schools is often seen as an ideal and accessible option, I firmly believe that private schools offer a more advantageous environment for both academic and personal growth.\nOn one hand, public schools provide accessible education with either free or affordable tuition, regardless of students' financial circumstances. For instance, in Vietnam, private schools charge fees ranging from 7 to 10 million VND per month, while public schools offer considerably more affordable tuition fees, ranging from 2 to 3 million VND for two terms. Another merit is that public schools excel in providing well-trained educators. Public schools typically require their teachers to meet rigorous certification and qualification standards. Teachers in public schools are often required to have at least a bachelor?? degree in education and pass standardized teacher certification exams, ensuring a solid foundation in subject matter expertise.\nOn the other hand, private schools offer compelling advantages that make them an attractive choice for students seeking education. Firstly, private schools maintain smaller class sizes, which can make it easier for teachers to effectively engage with each student, ultimately improving the quality of education delivered. For example, public school classrooms can sometimes accommodate as many as 50 students, a stark contrast to the more manageable class sizes of around 30 in private schools. Secondly, private schools are equipped with cutting-edge facilities such as laboratories and state-of-the-art IT rooms, which can facilitate hands-on experiments and provide comprehensive learning experiences across various subjects. Thirdly, the flexible curriculums in private schools are a significant benefit. Since they are not managed by the nation, they can tailor academic subjects to better suit their students' needs.\nIn conclusion, there are merits to both public schools and private schools. Individuals should make an informed decision that aligns with their individual needs and aspirations. This choice will ultimately pave the way for a well-rounded and meaningful academic journey.\n"

However, I respectfully disagree with this notion.\nI believe that the idea that local history outweighs world history should be reconsidered. It is true that in the past, a deep understanding of local historical values may have sufficed for one's daily life. However, times have changed, and the world has become increasingly globalized. With international business and a rise in migrant workers, every community has become a part of the global village. In this context, comprehending the history of other countries becomes essential, as it can foster stronger relationships between local residents and expatriates from those nations.\nFurthermore, I am firmly convinced that children derive the most benefit when learning local history concurrently with world history. To grasp a local historical event, children should take into account the regional and sometimes global context of that historical era. For instance, children should recognize that Vietnam's regaining of independence after defeating Japanese troops in Indochina in 1945 occurred in the wake of various significant events during World War II, including Japan's surrender to the Allies. This holistic approach to learning history enables children to gain a deeper and more thorough understanding.\nAll available evidence supports the idea that studying local history should go hand in hand with the study of world history. This practice ensures that children acquire a comprehensive understanding of history and can build stronger connections with migrant workers in their country.\n"

There is an ongoing debate about whether technological advancements have transformed the way students learn, making traditional schooling unnecessary in favor of home-based study. However, I firmly disagree with this idea.\nOn the one hand, the Internet offers several advantages for students who wish to engage in self-study. One notable benefit is the vast and readily accessible source of information it provides, enabling children to explore a wide range of topics independently, without the need for a teacher's guidance. Additionally, students can take advantage of distance learning programs, regardless of their geographic location. For instance, they can access virtual classrooms such as Zoom, Google Meet, and Messenger from the comfort of their own homes, eliminating the necessity for physical classrooms.\nOn the other hand, the Internet is not a suitable substitute for traditional schooling when it comes to educating children at home. In many households, both parents are employed during the day, making it unrealistic to expect a student to spend the entire day studying online without distractions. In a classroom setting, teachers enforce discipline, and when students study under supervision, their progress is closely monitored and guided by teachers who provide valuable feedback. This ensures that students do not lag behind in their studies.\nFurthermore, during a child's formative years, teachers play a pivotal role in imparting basic literacy and numeracy skills. During these early stages, teachers act as mentors who directly interact with students and instill in them the value of learning. While interactive learning is possible through online platforms, it often takes the form of multiple-choice questions and answers. There is no substitute for face-to-face learning, where students can interact with both teachers and their peers. In physical classrooms, children have the opportunity to engage in group discussions, which promotes collaboration and socialization. This, in turn, helps them develop essential skills such as teamwork and effective communication. Building relationships and fostering a dynamic, collaborative classroom environment is crucial for their overall development, and these outcomes cannot be achieved when students study at home.\nIn conclusion, while digital tools offer valuable online learning resources, we should not overly rely on them. As mentioned above, I would argue that the Internet cannot replace traditional schooling.\n"

From my perspective, this trend is not a positive one.\nTo begin with, it is undeniable that small living spaces do offer certain advantages to homeowners, such as time and cost savings. When individuals have limited living space, they are compelled to make tough decisions about what to keep, what to discard, and what to add to their homes. This fosters a simple and frugal lifestyle, reducing the time spent on cleaning and allowing residents to allocate their savings towards more essential services like healthcare and home maintenance. Clearly, this trend can be highly beneficial, particularly for those with tight budgets or demanding work schedules.\nNevertheless, opponents of this housing trend argue that smaller living spaces can lead to health risks and privacy concerns. This is particularly evident among older individuals and those who suffer from claustrophobia, as being confined within four walls on a daily basis can be mentally distressing. In contrast, larger, open spaces with access to nature and sunlight can significantly enhance mental well-being and provide greater convenience by offering more room for organizing personal belongings. Moreover, micro-housing is not conducive to large families, as the lack of privacy becomes a significant issue. For example, teenagers, who often require their own space, are forced to share rooms with their parents and siblings, resulting in unwanted disturbances and disputes among family members.\nIn conclusion, while living in a compact space does offer compelling advantages in terms of time and money savings, it also brings the potential for health-related problems and challenges related to overcrowding. All things considered, it is prudent to view the trend toward smaller living spaces as a negative development.\n"

The reality is that developed nations host numerous prestigious universities, attracting talent from all corners of the globe. Consequently, international students, who have the opportunity to pursue education in these countries, can access modern, high-quality education and gain valuable expertise in their chosen fields, such as technology and human resources, under the guidance of highly qualified instructors and peers from diverse backgrounds. When these students return to their homeland, they can apply their specialized knowledge and skills to local companies, thereby enhancing the quality of the local economy and ultimately contributing to the country's development.\nNevertheless, there are certain challenges associated with studying abroad, and the most significant of these is the phenomenon known as \"brain drain,\" particularly prevalent in developing countries. In reality, many international students opt to remain in the foreign country where they pursued their education instead of returning to their home nation. This issue primarily stems from the fact that these students can secure well-paying jobs in the host countries, while the employment conditions in their home country may not be conducive to applying the knowledge acquired abroad. Furthermore, the work environment also plays a crucial role in this decision. For instance, overseas students are accustomed to freely expressing their opinions and embracing diversity. However, upon returning home, the business practices may not readily welcome diverse viewpoints but instead tend to adhere to strict employer directives.

In my opinion, private schools should be considered a better choice.\nOn one hand, those who favor private schools have valid reasons for their preference. Firstly, the tuition fees in public schools are significantly lower than those in private schools. Public schools benefit from government funding, which reduces the financial burden on parents. Additionally, private schools often employ more highly qualified educators. They are required to meet strict standards in terms of qualifications, teaching experience, and subject knowledge. This, in turn, leads to a deeper understanding of school subjects and improved academic performance among students.\nOn the other hand, I still maintain the belief that private schools offer more advantages to children. Firstly, these schools typically have smaller class sizes, accommodating around 15 to 20 students. This allows teachers to readily observe students' participation in class and provide timely support. Secondly, private schools can integrate cutting-edge learning facilities into their teaching methods, thanks to various sources of funding. For instance, state-of-the-art laboratories can enhance children's comprehension of chemical reactions. Finally, private schools have the flexibility to design curricula that cater to students' academic abilities, rather than strictly adhering to a national curriculum.\nIn conclusion, despite the merits of public schools, I lean towards private schools due to their smaller class sizes, modern facilities, and adaptable curricular options.\n"

This essay will discuss some reasons supporting my perspective.\nOn the one hand, there are also arguments in favor of the idea that companies making money is the top priority, which is the most important thing. Firstly, companies earn money to pay taxes to the government, so the funds the government receives from taxes can then be spent on building hospitals, schools, and nursing homes. This means they can provide a life full of conveniences for citizens. Additionally, enterprises generate more job opportunities for citizens, helping them support their personal lives.\nOn the other hand, there are also reasons why enterprises should be responsible for social duties. One crucial purpose is that corporations must not contribute to environmental degradation. For example, carbon-intensive industries lead to global warming, which is irresponsible. Therefore, implementing a waste management system and raising public awareness can mitigate these issues. Furthermore, businesses can contribute to the community through charity and scholarships. For instance, Vinamilk is a business that pays significant attention to social responsibility activities, in addition to focusing on investing in economic activities to create quality products and promote environmentally friendly sustainable development.\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly agree with the idea that businesses should be responsible to the broader community.

They not only strive to entertain and foster creativity but also inspire the younger generation. Furthermore, they play a significant role in philanthropy, utilizing their earnings for charitable causes. Instead of being distant figures seen only on television, they are increasingly engaging with the public through practical initiatives and actions. This is a compelling reason to acknowledge their contributions and consider supporting their careers financially.\nOn the other hand, the arts industry is more lucrative than ever, with artists, musicians, and poets earning substantial incomes.

Let's examine whether the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.\nOne notable drawback of implementing this initiative is the financial burden it places on the government. Government authorities would need to invest in training educators who can instruct students on the proper methods of cultivating vegetables and tending to animals. They would also need to upgrade existing facilities or create new ones to accommodate these activities. For instance, if a school decides to teach young children how to grow carrots, they must allocate resources to establish dedicated areas for cultivation, purchase the necessary tools for plowing and planting, and provide adequate maintenance. All of these educational endeavors come with a significant cost that must be covered by government funds.\nNevertheless, the acquisition of practical knowledge can significantly contribute to a child's holistic development. By learning how to cultivate vegetables and care for pets, young children not only become more aware of everyday responsibilities but also gain valuable life lessons, such as tolerance and determination when facing unfamiliar challenges. For instance, when children learn how to grow various types of vegetables, they can apply these skills in unconventional situations where food supply may be scarce. Over time, this fosters patience and resilience, helping them tackle future difficulties with confidence.\nIn conclusion, despite the financial strain on national budgets to provide suitable educational conditions for teaching these fundamental skills, it is crucial to implement practical lessons in animal husbandry and plant cultivation as part of children's education.

      "paragraph": "In numerous countries worldwide, rural populations have been dwindling as people from rural areas move to cities. From my perspective, this can have adverse effects on both human society and the national economy.\nOne of the primary negative consequences is the overcrowding of cities, mainly due to the lack of effective government initiatives to create employment opportunities in rural and suburban regions. Consequently, individuals feel compelled to relocate to cities in pursuit of better prospects. As a result, issues like traffic congestion and a scarcity of housing inevitably arise. For instance, in Tokyo, a significant number of people migrate to the capital city in search of job opportunities, leading to a widespread shortage of housing and deteriorating living conditions. This, in turn, results in many families being cramped into tiny houses that are only a few square meters in size.\nMoreover, the annual migration of a large number of individuals has a profound impact on agriculture. This poses a threat to the economies of developed nations that heavily depend on food exports, such as rice and fruits. The declining rural population leads to a shortage of individuals available to cultivate the fields. Furthermore, the absence of experienced and skilled farmers in food production results in a decline in product quality and a scarcity of food.\nIn conclusion, the migration from rural to urban areas brings forth several adverse issues. It not only presents significant challenges related to employment and housing but also jeopardizes food supply and the overall economy. To address these problems, governments should contemplate the development of more industrial parks to alleviate the employment burden in urban areas.

In my view, although reading can contribute to a child's imagination to some extent, it is more advantageous for them to be involved in more active pastimes.\nPeople who have an interest in reading can indeed foster creativity. Most parents often read stories to their children, not only to impart moral lessons but also to enhance their creativity. Each story typically features vivid imagery that captivates and holds the attention of many children. Consequently, children are inclined to mimic activities from these stories. As children grow older, they can uncover additional creative elements in reading, such as characters and plots. This enables them to use reading as a means to envision diverse worlds in their minds. Through this process, children can enhance their creativity and develop unique ways of thinking.\nHowever, if children engage in entertaining activities, they can not only enhance their creativity but also their overall skills, particularly in communication. It is widely acknowledged that children can improve themselves through various activities, including both indoor and outdoor games. When children are at home, parents can encourage them to engage in activities such as painting or arts and crafts instead of reading. This allows children to explore different colors, materials, and learn how to create something tangible. Outdoor games also play a pivotal role in fostering children's communication skills, as they must collaborate and interact with their teammates when playing sports like basketball and football. To achieve success, they must support and communicate effectively with their friends.

Below, we will delve into some reasons for this shift, followed by an examination of whether this development is advantageous or detrimental to consumers.\nUndeniably, there are various factors contributing to the diminished impact of advertisements. Foremost among these is the widespread presence of generic advertising, owing to the influence of mass media and digital advancements. Banners and other commonplace advertising forms no longer hold the same allure for individuals, as they have become highly familiar with them. In contrast, in the past, when access to advertising was primarily through newspapers and television, consumers faced challenges in obtaining product information, prompting them to pay closer attention to these limited advertisements. Another significant factor can be attributed to heightened consumer awareness regarding the commercial nature of advertising. Many individuals today understand that advertising serves primarily commercial interests, leading them to become more immune to these activities due to skepticism about the accuracy and utility of the information presented.\nHowever, I believe that this trend can yield several financial benefits for consumers. The most prominent advantage is that it discourages impulsive spending decisions, potentially saving consumers a considerable amount of money. For instance, if individuals refrain from purchasing skincare products solely based on their frequent appearances in their Facebook and Instagram feeds without scrutinizing their ingredients and suitability, they are less likely to waste money on products ill-suited for their skin.\nIn conclusion, the reasons behind the declining influence of advertising can be attributed to increased awareness and the ubiquity of social media networks.

In the past, extended families, where three or four generations lived together under one roof, were common. However, these have been replaced by nuclear families, where only married couples live with their children. Additionally, the roles of parents have evolved considerably. In the past, men were primarily responsible for providing for the family, while women were in charge of child-rearing, cooking, and household chores. Nowadays, families often receive financial support from both spouses, and in some cases, husbands choose to stay at home and become stay-at-home fathers. This shift promotes gender equality, granting women equal roles not only in family life but also in the workforce.\nAdmittedly, these differences bring numerous benefits to both families and society as a whole. First and foremost, the prevalence of nuclear family units reduces generational conflicts and offers more privacy to each family member. For example, a couple in a nuclear family can enjoy the freedom of living independently, without interference from older family members, and the financial burden is also reduced. Furthermore, the situation for women has improved compared to joint family arrangements. They have careers, making them financially independent and more empowered in family-related matters.

In this essay, we will explore both perspectives before I share my own opinion on this contentious issue.\nOn one hand, education plays a crucial role in shaping values and skills that drive societal progress. Advocates of this view argue that schools should impart common values, knowledge, and skills that align with the needs of society. For instance, schools teach students about their civic rights and responsibilities in democratic societies. Additionally, curricula often cover subjects like history and geography to help students develop an understanding of their cultural heritage and national identity. Moreover, education equips students with practical skills for career success, which further contributes to economic growth. In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education due to rapid advancements in these fields. Such a focus on preparing students for productive careers helps build a skilled workforce capable of addressing complex problems and driving innovation.\nOn the other hand, many argue that education should concentrate on fostering individual growth and enabling the pursuit of personal ambitions. This perspective underscores the importance of nurturing talents, creativity, and critical thinking to empower individuals to explore their passions and make meaningful contributions to society. Comprehensive education that prioritizes emotional intelligence, cultural competence, and interpersonal skills is also considered essential for personal development. These skills can significantly contribute to an individual's well-being, career success, and ability to build strong relationships with others.\nIn conclusion, both the societal preparation and personal ambition approaches to education have their merits. In my opinion, an effective educational system should strike a balance between both perspectives. By adopting a holistic approach that combines societal preparation with personal development goals, educational systems can meet the diverse needs of learners and promote well-rounded individuals capable of making meaningful contributions to their communities.\n"

      "question": "Discuss the ethical implications of animal testing for medical research.",
      "paragraph": "It is indeed a fact that medicines and various other products undergo regular testing on animals before they receive approval for human use. While I lean toward the perspective that animal testing is morally questionable, I do acknowledge the need for some level of animal experimentation, particularly in the context of medicine development.\nOn one side of the argument, there exist compelling ethical objections to animal experimentation. As a common illustration of this practice, laboratory mice may be intentionally subjected to illnesses to assess the efficacy of new drugs. Critics of such research contend that humans should not inflict such suffering upon animals and emphasize the importance of respecting the lives of all creatures. They argue that the potential benefits to humans do not outweigh the harm caused and advocate for scientists to explore alternative research methods.\nConversely, it is not always feasible to find reliable substitutes for animal experimentation. Advocates for using animals in medical research argue that, in cases where human lives can be saved, a certain degree of suffering endured by mice or rats may be justifiable. They posit that those who oppose such research might alter their stance if a family member required a medical treatment that had been developed through animal experimentation. Personally, I support the prohibition of animal testing for non-medical products, but I believe it may be a necessary but regrettable practice when it comes to developing new drugs and medical procedures.\nIn conclusion, it is my perspective that a ban on animal testing for essential medical research should only be considered when equally effective alternative methods have been successfully developed.\n"

      "paragraph": "In the modern era, due to the relentless pursuit of financial success by individuals, there has been a noticeable trend of people spending less time with their families. Several factors contribute to this trend and result in certain consequences, as discussed below.\nTo begin with, there are various reasons behind the gradual decrease in the amount of time people spend with their families. Firstly, both adults and young people are experiencing increased pressure due to demanding work schedules and academic commitments. Consequently, they often choose to work overtime or study late into the night to fulfill their responsibilities rather than dedicating time to discussing these challenges with their parents. Secondly, the excessive use of technology plays a significant role in this shift. In the digital age, with the proliferation of advanced devices and social media platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, and others, many young individuals tend to become engrossed in their screens and isolated from their family members.\nThis growing phenomenon has several implications for family relationships. The lack of quality family time results in increased emotional distance among family members, leading to misunderstandings, conflicts, and, in some cases, even divorce. For instance, when parents prioritize work over spending time with their children, the latter may struggle academically and become susceptible to mental health issues like depression and anxiety disorders. In the worst-case scenario, they may engage in criminal activities or even contemplate suicide. Consequently, this trend contributes to a rise in criminality within the society.\nIn conclusion, allocating time to spend with one's family is not only essential but also beneficial for everyone involved. Such quality time can help mitigate many of the negative consequences observed in society and improve human relationships.\n"

While some advocate for the benefits they offer to humanity, I firmly assert that these experiments should be prohibited due to the moral issue of causing suffering to animals.\nOn one hand, proponents argue that animal experiments are advantageous for humans. Firstly, they argue that it is easier to study organisms of certain animals that share similar functions and structures with humans.

For example, rabbits can give birth to five or six offspring in succession, ensuring a constant supply of animals for research purposes.\nOn the other hand, I hold the view that this practice is morally objectionable for several reasons. Firstly, such actions can have adverse effects on the ecosystem as a whole. This is mainly because utilizing animals for unsuccessful experiments can result in genetic mutations. For instance, monkeys have been transformed into aggressive creatures due to the injection of certain medicines into their bodies. Consequently, genetically modified organisms that reproduce rapidly can pose dangers to society.

      "paragraph": "Advertising is crucial in our society when it comes to promoting popular consumer products. It is widely acknowledged that the substantial sales figures of these items are largely attributed to the impact of advertising rather than actual societal needs. I completely agree with this viewpoint.\nFirst and foremost, advertising techniques have evolved over time, making it challenging for consumers to distinguish between their genuine needs and the desires fabricated by advertisers. For instance, companies employ social media platforms to target specific consumer groups and manipulate their emotions, creating a sense of necessity for products they might not have previously considered.\nFurthermore, businesses often allocate a significant portion of their budget to advertising and promotion rather than enhancing the quality of their products or providing better services to their customers. This is evident in the case of many fast-food restaurants, which invest a substantial portion of their funds in advertising rather than offering healthier meal alternatives.\nLastly, there is evidence to suggest that external factors such as peer pressure and societal norms frequently influence consumer behavior. Advertisements capitalize on these societal standards to persuade individuals into purchasing items they don't genuinely require. Take, for instance, the recent trend among young people of using expensive and trendy smartphones. While some individuals may genuinely need the features and capabilities of such devices, others may succumb to social pressure to acquire the latest and most popular brand. Advertisements featuring celebrities or social media influencers using these phones can intensify this pressure and create a perceived necessity to conform, resulting in unnecessary purchases.\nIn conclusion, advertising plays a significant role in shaping consumer behavior and driving sales of popular consumer goods. Therefore, it is crucial for consumers to become more aware of the influence of advertising and make informed decisions about their purchases.\n"

Some people believe that it is good to share as much information as possible, while others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely.\nThere are several arguments in favor of sharing information. First, it can help accelerate scientific progress. When scientists share their data and findings, it allows other researchers to build on their work and make new discoveries. This can lead to the development of new technologies and treatments that can benefit society.\nSecond, sharing information can promote innovation. When businesses share their ideas and insights, it can help create new products and services that can improve people's lives.

When students have access to the latest research and findings, they can be better prepared for the workforce and for life in general. This can lead to a more informed and engaged citizenry.\nHowever, there are also some arguments against sharing information. One concern is that it could lead to the loss of a competitive advantage. If businesses share their trade secrets, it could allow their competitors to copy their products or services. This could harm the business and its employees.\nAnother concern is that sharing information could be a security risk. If sensitive information is shared, it could be used by criminals or terrorists. This could pose a threat to national security.\nFinally, some people believe that there are certain types of information that should not be shared, such as personal information or information that could be used to harm others.\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to share information is a complex one. There are both benefits and risks to consider. In each case, it is important to weigh the pros and cons carefully before making a decision.\nIn my opinion, the benefits of sharing information outweigh the risks. When information is shared freely, it can lead to great progress in science, business, and education. It can also help create a more informed and engaged citizenry. However, it is important to be mindful of the risks and to take steps to mitigate them. For example, businesses can share their trade secrets with trusted partners or with the government.

      "paragraph": "The decision to take a gap year before starting college has become increasingly popular among school leavers. While taking a gap year offers certain benefits, it also has its shortcomings. This essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of taking a gap year and discuss whether the benefits outweigh the potential drawbacks.\nOne significant advantage of a gap year is exposure to different cultures through traveling. Experiencing various cultural environments provides young adults with unique opportunities for personal growth that are seldom available during traditional academic studies. Exposure to diverse cultures leads to increased adaptability and fosters global perspectives, which are highly valued in today's interconnected world. Another advantage of taking time off before pursuing higher education is gaining work experience. Students may choose to use this opportunity to explore potential career paths or build practical skills relevant to their career goals. Furthermore, working during a gap year provides financial benefits; students can start saving money, which could later be used to cover tuition fees or other expenses associated with university life.\nDespite its many advantages, taking a gap year before enrolling in a university program has its fair share of disadvantages as well. One significant concern is the potential loss of academic momentum. After spending an extended period away from school, especially engaging in non-academic pursuits like traveling or working full time, it can be challenging for students to readjust to the rigors of a demanding academic environment. Another disadvantage pertains to students potentially falling behind their peers who chose not to take time off. Consequently, they may face additional challenges concerning competition with other college students and miss crucial opportunities during their collegiate years. Additionally, since not all universities provide accommodations for students who partake in gap years, undertaking this venture might diminish the likelihood of admission into a preferred college.\nIn conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to taking a gap year before diving into higher education. However, although it may not be suitable for everyone, the positive aspects of a gap year can outweigh the drawbacks for some individuals. Each student must take into consideration their personal circumstances, goals, and aspirations when deciding whether a gap year is the right choice for them.\n"

      "paragraph": "The swift expansion of the elderly population in numerous countries is a phenomenon that carries both advantages and disadvantages. In my view, this demographic shift is a multifaceted issue that requires a balanced perspective, but its overall impact on society can be largely favorable. To commence, the presence of a larger elderly population bestows several advantages. Initially, it signifies improvements in healthcare and living standards, as people are enjoying longer and healthier lives. This showcases advancements in the medical field and social support systems. Furthermore, elderly individuals often possess a wealth of knowledge and experience, which can be utilized to benefit society. They can serve as mentors and contribute to conversations across generations, fostering a sense of continuity and tradition within communities. Additionally, an older workforce can also provide stability in certain industries, such as skilled craftsmanship or specialized professions, which rely on accumulated expertise.\nNevertheless, there are also challenges linked to an aging population. One significant concern is the burden it places on pension and healthcare systems. As a larger proportion of the population enters retirement, there may be increased pressure on government resources to provide adequate care and support. Moreover, a diminishing working-age population can potentially lead to economic challenges, as there may be fewer individuals contributing to social security and tax revenue.\nIn conclusion, while the rapid growth of the elderly population presents both advantages and disadvantages, I believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. It signifies progress in healthcare and social support, capitalizes on the experience of older individuals, and fosters stability in certain sectors. With careful planning and resource allocation, societies can effectively address the challenges associated with an aging population while harnessing its potential for positive contributions.\n"

From my point of view, while reading can help children develop their imagination to some extent, it is better to involve them in more active pastimes.\nPeople interested in reading can stimulate creativity. Most parents usually read stories to their children not only to impart moral lessons but also to enhance their creativity. In every story, the author paints vivid pictures that captivate and hold the attention of many children. Therefore, children are likely to mimic the activities from the story. As children grow older, they can discover other creative elements in reading, such as characters and plots. Then, they can use reading as a means to imagine a different world in their minds. This way, children can boost their creativity and think differently from others.\nHowever, if children engage in entertaining activities, they will not only develop creativity but also overall skills, especially in communication. It is broadly recognized that children can improve themselves through various activities, including both indoor and outdoor games. When children stay at home, parents can encourage them to paint or engage in arts and crafts instead of reading, giving them a chance to learn about different colors, types of paper, and how to create something unique. Outdoor games play an important role in developing a child's communication skills because they must interact with other teammates when playing sports such as basketball and football.

From my perspective, although there are some drawbacks, this phenomenon brings about several improvements in modern life. The increase in the elderly population is primarily attributed to advances in healthcare. To elaborate, the progress in specialized nutrition and enhanced medical support ensures a higher quality of life. Consequently, life expectancy is extended, and the aging process slows down. For instance, in Japan, citizens receive exceptional care due to economic development and advancements in the medical industry. Moreover, they have access to clean and nutritious food. As a result, research indicates that the average lifespan of the Japanese population is notably high.\nDespite these advantages, the growing number of elderly individuals also comes with two notable drawbacks. The expansion of this demographic group contributes to a global population increase. When combined with a high birth rate, it can lead to an uncontrollable surge in global population. This, in turn, may result in more people without homes and insufficient access to food, giving rise to societal issues. Furthermore, a high elderly population rate and a low young population rate can have adverse effects on a nation's economy and culture.

Personally, I wholeheartedly concur with this notion.\nTo illustrate, let's take the example of Shopee, one of Vietnam's popular online shopping platforms, which attracts both young individuals and adults. Companies frequently entice customers with discounts on various products, including clothing and jewelry, as a means to promote their brands. Consequently, these companies craftily lead customers to believe that they are getting value-for-money deals, creating a sense of urgency to buy before the opportunity slips away.\nFurthermore, the relentless advancement of technology has enabled advertisements to permeate various aspects of our lives. They infiltrate social networks, often camouflaged as user-generated review posts, which can easily mislead individuals into believing in the quality of products and services. Consequently, consumers make purchases without conducting thorough research, which can ultimately undermine their own interests.\nAdditionally, celebrity endorsements play a pivotal role in swaying consumer choices. Companies frequently enlist well-known personalities to endorse their products, creating the impression that using these products is synonymous with supporting one's idols. This emotional connection often prompts consumers to spend substantial amounts of money without considering whether the purchase is truly necessary.\nIn conclusion, I am in full agreement with the notion that advertising exerts a dominant influence on consumer purchasing behavior, overshadowing the genuine needs of the society.

From my perspective, I firmly disagree with this view.\nThe first justification for my disagreement is that reducing taxes for families who pay for private education may give rise to a situation where poorer people pay higher taxes than the rich. This seems to stem from the fact that if wealthy families were given tax cuts as their children do not participate in public schools, governments would have to increase taxes for those whose children take part in state education. Furthermore, people often pay a certain amount of tax for public services even though there is little use of them. For example, most people are fortunate enough not to have to call the police or fire brigade at any time in their lives, but they would not expect a tax reduction for this.\nIn my opinion, affluent families should pay their fair share of money that supports public schools, which is not only beneficial for them but also for all members of society. To illustrate, thanks to taxes, the government has been able to maintain a high-quality education system with equal opportunities for all young people. This will result in a well-educated workforce, and thus a more productive and prosperous nation. Parents of children in private schools are shrewd enough to foresee the advantages of this in their own lives.

One of the primary reasons is the marketing strategies employed by restaurants, such as the promotion of 'buy one, get one free' deals or serving large portions. These tactics often encourage individuals to buy more food than they can actually consume, leading to food being wasted. For instance, Loteria, a well-known fast-food restaurant in Vietnam, is famous for its economical lunch combinations. However, many customers often find themselves unable to finish the entire quantity of food they order.\nAnother contributing factor is the quality of the food itself. Some foods are excessively spicy or sweet, making it challenging for consumers to finish them. For example, tourists visiting countries renowned for their spicy cuisine may struggle to consume local dishes, resulting in leftover food.\nTo address this issue, various solutions can be considered. One effective approach is for restaurants to impose fines on customers who leave behind uneaten food. This would make customers more conscious of the quantity of food they order. Dokki, a Korean food buffet restaurant in Vietnam, has successfully implemented this policy by charging $5 for every 100 grams of leftovers. Since its introduction, there has been a significant reduction in the amount of food wasted.\nAdditionally, stores can contribute to minimizing food waste by offering food samples to customers.

      "question": "To what extent do you agree that communication technology can have positive effects on building strong connections between individuals in certain situations?",
      "paragraph": "Over the past few decades, due to the rapid proliferation of technology, the use of technology in everyday communication has become increasingly popular. However, some individuals are concerned that communication technology could potentially harm interpersonal relationships in the future. While there is some validity to this viewpoint, I am of the opinion that it can have some positive effects on building strong connections between individuals in certain situations.\nOn one hand, there are several reasons why some people argue that technology can lead to social isolation. To be more specific, we often observe friends meeting for coffee who become engrossed in their mobile phones, or parents and children spending their evenings on social media instead of engaging in face-to-face conversations. Additionally, conflicts that occur online can be problematic to resolve, as emotions and attitudes are not always clearly conveyed and can even be misinterpreted.\nOn the other hand, modern communication technology can facilitate interactions among people. Collaborating with individuals from all over the world, regardless of distance, enables students to gain diverse knowledge. Moreover, students can stay connected with their families when studying in different cities or foreign countries. Furthermore, it allows people to make new friends online, thereby expanding their social networks. Facebook groups serve as a prime example of this phenomenon. In reality, people with shared interests come together in these groups to connect and exchange knowledge.\nIn conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies can contribute to improving various situations, despite their drawbacks. Therefore, it is the responsibility of each individual to use them wisely.\n"

I strongly oppose this viewpoint, given that academic learning not only enhances communication skills but also respects each individual's aspirations.\nOne of the primary reasons for my disagreement is that higher education significantly improves communication skills, particularly specialized courses in public speaking. To put it simply, some institutions offer specific courses in public communication that focus on enhancing speaking skills, body language, and the confidence to deliver effective speeches and presentations.

      "paragraph": "In today's world, online meetings are gaining increasing popularity. From my perspective, the advantages of this mode of interaction far outweigh the disadvantages. Online meetings offer numerous benefits in the modern age, especially in light of the digital technology revolution. Online business meetings, discussions, and training sessions are incredibly convenient for individuals with busy schedules. Consequently, they can save a significant amount of time that would otherwise be spent organizing and attending face-to-face meetings.\nFor example, students from all across Vietnam can quickly collaborate through online meeting platforms like Google Meet, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. Thanks to these modern digital tools, students can receive a complete educational program without disruptions caused by the pandemic. However, there are two common drawbacks associated with online meetings. Firstly, users sometimes encounter connectivity issues resulting from network congestion when multiple people are using the internet simultaneously. Consequently, this can disrupt job meetings or study sessions. Secondly, there is a limitation in terms of interaction. Through a screen, teachers or speakers may struggle to convey their message comprehensively, creating difficulties for students or listeners in fully understanding the content.\nIn conclusion, while online meetings do have some drawbacks, in my opinion, this mode of interaction is exceptionally convenient and should be widely embraced due to the convenience it offers, which offline meetings lack. It is recommended that people consider both online and offline meetings and choose the most suitable option based on their specific circumstances to maintain flexibility in their work or study arrangements.\n"

While some argue that spending time with family can strengthen relationships and provide valuable lessons from elders, my perspective aligns with the opposing view, which suggests that participating in outdoor activities can help individuals expand their horizons and enhance their social skills.\nOn one hand, some believe that allocating leisure time to families offers tangible benefits. Firstly, it fosters stronger family bonds. When young people spend their free time with their families, they can better understand other family members and create lasting memories. Additionally, they have the opportunity to gain wisdom and advice from their elders. This is because older family members, such as grandparents and parents, can offer valuable guidance by sharing stories and insights during leisure hours.\nOn the other hand, I concur with the idea that outdoor entertainment is advantageous for young people. Firstly, it exposes them to a broader range of life experiences and enriches their personal development. This exposure to diverse perspectives and experiences can contribute to their personal growth. Secondly, it enhances their communication skills. Engaging in activities such as sports requires social interaction and the opportunity to make new friends.\nIn conclusion, while some advocate for young individuals to unwind with their families, citing the benefits of strengthening family ties and acquiring wisdom from older generations, I am in complete agreement with those who believe that engaging in outdoor entertainment can enhance their knowledge and socialization skills.\n"

      "paragraph": "In recent years, there has been a growing trend of people using mobile phones in public places. Some individuals argue that this behavior is becoming as socially unacceptable as smoking. When considering the advantages of prohibiting mobile phone use in these settings, implementing such a rule presents significant challenges. This is primarily because mobile phones are small and easily hidden, making it difficult for authorities to detect and enforce a ban effectively.\nOne compelling reason to support regulating phone usage is that phones can be distracting. People may become irritated by loud ringtones or the glow of phone screens when they need to concentrate. For instance, students in a classroom might play games or surf the internet during lectures. Moreover, such actions can also disrupt the concentration of other students. The sound of a ringing phone or the brightness of a phone screen can divert the attention of fellow students away from the lesson, potentially hindering their learning experience. Additionally, there is a risk of accidents on the road caused by a lack of focus due to mobile phones. Drivers may be tempted to respond to messages or engage in phone calls, leading to unfortunate consequences.\nFurthermore, mobile phones have been observed to reduce human interaction during public events. For example, at concerts or gatherings, individuals often prioritize taking photos or videos with their phones instead of engaging with those around them. This trend can contribute to a society where meaningful face-to-face connections are increasingly rare, and people rely more on the virtual world for social interaction.\nNevertheless, a complete ban on mobile phones is not practical. These devices have become indispensable in modern life, serving as essential tools for communication, staying informed about current events, and receiving important instructions. For instance, during natural disasters, mobile phones have played a vital role in coordinating emergency responses and disseminating crucial information to the public. Therefore, while acknowledging the drawbacks associated with mobile phone use in public places, I believe that instead of an outright ban, there should be clear signs or reminders to regulate phone usage in specific situations.\nIn conclusion, despite the disadvantages, mobile phones are integral to our daily lives. In my opinion, the best approach is to implement signs or reminders to encourage responsible phone usage.\n"

      "paragraph": "In contemporary society, there is an ongoing trend where many individuals tend to spend excessive amounts of money on unnecessary items. While this trend can be attributed to various reasons, I believe that it could have negative implications for both individuals and society in the long run.\nOn one hand, there are numerous reasons explaining the growing popularity of consumerism. Firstly, the power of advertising plays a significant role in encouraging excessive buying. Various methods, such as newspapers, billboards, and social media platforms, are used for product promotion. These commercials provide vivid visuals and captivating sound effects, arousing consumers' curiosity. Consequently, people engage in impulsive purchases and accrue debts. Celebrity endorsements serve as a prime example. When admired figures endorse specific products, their sales often skyrocket, especially among young people who tend to imitate their idols. Furthermore, the widespread use of mass production technology has made low-priced products easily accessible. The proliferation of machinery and assembly lines enables companies to manufacture a wide range of affordable products, making them accessible to individuals across different income levels. However, this also leads to a short product life cycle and contributes to environmental pollution, including soil and water contamination.\nIndividuals living in this throwaway society may suffer significantly. It is unwise to spend money on unnecessary items when it could be better utilized in important areas like education or travel experiences. On a societal level, the overconsumption of low-priced consumer goods can have a detrimental impact on the environment. The overproduction of poor-quality goods that quickly deteriorate results in the generation of significant amounts of hazardous waste, which is released into the environment, directly polluting soil and water.\nIn conclusion, there are several factors contributing to the emergence of our throwaway society. Increased consumer debt and environmental damage are the two major problems stemming from this phenomenon.\n"

      "paragraph": "Over the past few decades, due to the rapid advancement of technology, robotics has found extensive applications like never before. While some individuals argue that the use of robots can bring about numerous advantages, others are concerned about the potential threats they may pose to human society in the long term. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for both perspectives before expressing my inclination towards the former.\nOn one hand, there are compelling reasons why some people believe that robots could have adverse effects on human beings. Firstly, as robotics technology advances significantly, unemployment rates may rise. To be more specific, robots can replace humans in performing repetitive and labor-intensive tasks, such as driving, factory work, or construction, with higher accuracy and efficiency. Consequently, individuals in these professions may struggle to earn a sufficient income, leading to a decline in their living standards. For instance, consider the case of drivers; it is anticipated that self-driving cars will eliminate the need for human drivers in society. Moreover, excessive reliance on life-saving devices can promote a sedentary lifestyle, potentially worsening human health and increasing vulnerability to lifestyle-related diseases like obesity and cardiovascular ailments.\nOn the other hand, I firmly believe that the benefits of robotics technology for humanity are more pronounced. In the medical field, bionic limbs assist individuals with mobility disabilities in carrying out their daily activities. These innovations empower many people with disabilities to lead more independent lives, enabling them to drive and even participate in sports. Furthermore, robots play a pivotal role in reducing human-to-human contact in disease-prone environments such as hospitals and medical facilities. Consequently, they contribute to maintaining a clean and sanitized hospital environment. Notably, advancements in nanotechnology allow robots to access narrow, deep, and challenging-to-reach areas within the human body without the need for complex surgeries. This precision and efficiency in surgery significantly surpass traditional open surgery and laparoscopic procedures.\nIn conclusion, while the use of robots may have some negative implications, there are methods to mitigate these drawbacks and harness their benefits, which, in my view, outweigh the adverse impacts.\n"

Some people believe that advancing technology can help reduce crime, while others argue that it may actually encourage criminal activity. In my view, I firmly agree with the perspective that cutting-edge technologies are likely to lead to an increase in criminal activities.\nOn one hand, it is understandable why some individuals prefer the idea of reducing crime through technological advancements rather than witnessing a rise in criminal activities due to these innovations. Firstly, new technologies, such as smartphones and computers, can be quite complex, making it difficult for criminals to use them effectively. However, it's important to note that a significant number of cybercrimes are on the rise, with the internet and modern technology serving as ideal tools for information theft. For instance, just three years ago, a person named Carlon Lee distributed a potent virus into a bank's computer system, resulting in a substantial financial loss. Thus, technological development can indeed attract more individuals towards unlawful activities.\nOn the other hand, it is evident that I, along with many others, support the argument that advanced technology can encourage criminal behavior. One significant drawback is that some hackers exploit cutting-edge technology for malicious purposes. The internet, in particular, provides them with ample opportunities to engage in illicit activities such as spreading viruses or stealing sensitive information. For instance, with just an internet-connected smartphone, hackers can breach a bank's security or deceive people on social media. Another compelling issue is the negative impact on communities worldwide and the serious threat posed to society. Many hackers compromise security cameras and home surveillance systems, which raises concerns about privacy and safety. Consequently, technological advances are contributing to a growing number of wrongdoers in society.\nIn conclusion, while there are undoubtedly advantages to technological development, it is crucial to recognize that unless effective solutions are implemented by governments, the number of criminals is likely to increase due to the influence of cutting-edge technologies.\n"

It is widely held that females excel as leaders compared to males. While this perspective has its merits, I maintain that effective leadership can be exhibited by individuals of both genders.\nOn one hand, research suggests that men may have an edge in terms of strategic thinking, a valuable skill for decision-making. For example, men often exhibit a willingness to take calculated risks in business, which can lead to rapid success, regardless of emotional factors. In contrast, women may sometimes lack this particular attribute.\nOn the other hand, some viewpoints argue that the preference for women in leadership roles is justified. Specifically, women's personalities can significantly benefit businesses and organizations. To delve deeper into this, women tend to possess a higher degree of empathy, enabling them to better understand their team members compared to men. For instance, female leaders often display genuine concern for their colleagues, providing emotional and professional support. Consequently, they can motivate their teams to progress and achieve greater success. Additionally, when women hold positions of authority in government, they can initiate legislative changes that promote gender equality, serving as an inspiration for other women to assert their rights. A notable example is Mary Robinson, the former President of Ireland, who championed gender-related campaigns, highlighting the pivotal role of women as leaders of change and champions of resilience, especially among ordinary women.\nIn conclusion, I believe that both genders possess unique strengths and essential qualities that can make them effective leaders. Instead of favoring one gender over the other, we should recognize and harness these diverse attributes to create a more balanced and inclusive leadership landscape.\n"

This essay will delve into the reasons for this trend and discuss ways in which people can explore the history of their homes.\nOne of the primary reasons for this trend is the desire to connect with the past. By learning about the history of their homes, people can gain a better understanding of the individuals who resided there before them, their way of life, and their contributions to society. It can also help people experience a sense of pride and belonging, as they become part of the continuum of the building's history. Another reason for the growing interest in the history of homes is the increase in property values. Many people believe that knowing the history of their home can add value to it, especially if the building holds significant historical or architectural value. It can also help people make informed decisions about renovations and improvements by better understanding the property's condition.\nThere are several ways in which people can research the history of their homes. One approach is to peruse public records such as property deeds, census data, and local archives. These sources can provide information about the original construction date, previous owners, and any significant events or renovations that have taken place over the years. Another approach is to engage in conversations with neighbors or members of the local historical society. They may possess information or anecdotes about the history of the building that can offer valuable insights. Additionally, people can explore online resources, such as historical databases, genealogy websites, and local history blogs.\nIn conclusion, the growing interest in the history of homes is driven by a desire to connect with the past, enhance property value, and gain a better understanding of the building's condition.

Some argue in favor of such sponsorship, while others consider it a wasteful expenditure.\nIt is undeniable that artists, musicians, and poets contribute significantly to society. They not only entertain and inspire creativity but also serve as role models, particularly for the younger generation. Furthermore, many of them engage in charitable activities, using their earnings to make a positive impact on the lives of others. Rather than being distant figures confined to television screens, they are increasingly involved in practical initiatives that bring them closer to their audience. This closeness between artists and their supporters underscores the importance of providing financial support to help them pursue their careers.\nHowever, in today's world, the arts industry is more lucrative than ever, allowing artists, musicians, and poets to amass substantial incomes. Their fame directly correlates with their financial success, and the advent of social media has further amplified their accessibility to audiences.

      "paragraph": "It is an undeniable fact that most people who visit museums and historical sites are tourists rather than locals. This essay aims to explain the main reasons for this trend and suggest several practical solutions.\nTo begin with, there are two primary reasons for this phenomenon. One significant factor is that local residents often feel that they do not gain essential information when they visit these places. Museums and historical sites primarily showcase the cultural and historical aspects of the local area, which locals might consider unnecessary as they have already learned about them during their schooling. Additionally, people tend to have a natural inclination to explore new places that are far from their hometown. Since they dedicate most of their year to work, except for those who prefer to relax at home during vacations, many are eager to embark on adventures to different towns, cities, or even countries to broaden their horizons. For example, someone living in New York might find it unexciting to visit The Statue of Liberty during their holiday.\nTo address this issue, there are some practical measures that can be taken. First and foremost, visits to museums and historical sites should be made more engaging and educational by offering a wider range of experiences that cannot be found in books. This can spark people's curiosity and create a greater interest in understanding their local culture and history, making locals more inclined to visit these places. Another crucial solution to consider is the renovation and enhancement of these historical buildings by the authorities. Restoring and improving these structures can make them more attractive, thereby appealing to a larger number of local residents. All of these approaches can be more effective if the government initiates campaigns aimed at encouraging people to explore these historical locations.\nIn conclusion, the main reasons for the dominance of tourists over locals at museums and historical sites are the limited information provided to locals and the natural human tendency to explore new places. To address this issue, it is advisable to diversify the content on display, undertake restoration and improvement efforts, and launch promotional campaigns to encourage visits to these locations.\n"

Conversely, others believe that the improved living standards have enhanced the lives of older people. This essay will comprehensively discuss both perspectives and present my personal viewpoint, which aligns with the latter opinion.\nOn one hand, the older demographic is a contentious issue in some developing countries that governments and local authorities are grappling with. In fact, many elderly individuals face issues related to social isolation. This can be attributed to the fact that their children have settled down and started their own families, leaving them to live alone. Consequently, when older people experience prolonged periods of loneliness, they may be more susceptible to depression and even serious mental illnesses. Furthermore, the elderly may encounter economic challenges, as their retirement benefits may not be sufficient to cover the cost of living in today's world. Therefore, it may be impossible for older people to cover all their daily expenses and meet their essential needs.\nOn the other hand, living conditions in the contemporary era have improved significantly due to advances in healthcare and virtual communication. Thanks to modern healthcare, older individuals can have their health monitored by medical professionals. This access to healthcare has significantly increased life expectancy, allowing them to enjoy their lives both mentally and physically. Additionally, their psychological well-being has been positively impacted by the advent of social media platforms. These platforms provide opportunities for the elderly to maintain remote relationships with their families, reducing the isolation experienced by this age group. Furthermore, online communities on the internet enable older individuals to establish new connections with people, expanding their social networks.\nIn conclusion, aging is an inevitable part of the human life cycle. However, in the future, it will be easier for older people to extend their lifespans due to improved access to healthcare. Moreover, issues of isolation may become less prevalent in the future as virtual platforms continue to serve as a means of remote communication. Nevertheless, it is imperative that adults take care of their parents' mental well-being by visiting them regularly and fostering connections between their children and grandparents. This will contribute to the overall mental health and happiness of the elderly.\n"

      "paragraph": "While there is a debate about whether scientific research should be carried out and controlled by private companies or governments, I firmly believe that the disadvantages of this proposition outweigh the benefits it may offer.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that conducting research independently can accelerate the pace of investigation. Having fewer individuals within the same company who share a common mindset can reduce the risk of tension arising during the process. If the research gains popularity and demand, it is inevitable that differing opinions will emerge from others. For instance, Pfizer, one of the leading private medical companies, developed the formula for the COVID-19 vaccine without government funding, potentially saving numerous lives.\nOn the other hand, if the responsibility for research falls on the government, there will be regulations and requirements that studies must adhere to. Since the government's primary focus is to govern the nation and ensure the well-being of its citizens, reports are essential to keep everything updated. Consequently, the results of government-led experiments are often more comprehensive and reliable compared to their privately funded counterparts. Furthermore, unlike private research, which relies on limited investments, public research often receives funding from various sources and is shared within the community. For example, consider Toyota, a pioneer in Japan's transportation industry, which received funding to develop a groundbreaking energy source, the fuel cell battery. This innovation holds the promise of replacing fossil fuels.\nIn conclusion, the drawbacks of private research outweigh the benefits, as it tends to have less credibility and receives less funding from the media and authorities.

      "paragraph": "It is indeed true that there is a noticeable increase in cross-border business and cultural exchange. While some individuals argue that this may have a negative impact by potentially eroding national identities, I firmly believe that the growing cultural and business interactions offer numerous advantages.\nThere are several compelling reasons why many people are concerned about the expansion of cultural and business contacts. Firstly, an excessive exchange of business and culture can lead to a weakening of national identities. This can be observed in the diminishing importance of traditional national holidays, which are sometimes overshadowed by foreign ones. Moreover, an excessive focus on cross-border business contacts can hinder economic growth. For instance, countries that excessively promote foreign-made products may reduce the consumption of domestically produced goods, which can have a detrimental effect on the national economy.\nHowever, I align with those who believe that increased contact between countries has its benefits. Firstly, from a cultural perspective, greater cultural exchange can foster a sense of cross-cultural understanding. This, in turn, promotes respect for cultural diversity, and international cooperation can significantly broaden one's horizons. In today's era of globalization and integration, these qualities are of paramount importance. On the business front, enhanced international cooperation stimulates economic growth. This is primarily due to the opportunities for expanding businesses and creating more job opportunities that arise from engaging in international trade and commerce. For example, Google has established company branches in nearly every corner of the world, thus creating job opportunities for thousands of individuals.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that there are some drawbacks to engaging in business and cultural contacts with other countries, these drawbacks are outweighed by the substantial benefits they bring.\n"

      "paragraph": "Due to urbanization, an increasing number of people are choosing to reside in cities. Consequently, these urban areas are becoming highly congested, leaving individuals with limited access to outdoor spaces. In my opinion, I firmly believe that this trend represents a negative development. In this essay, I will elucidate this issue by presenting specific reasons.\nTo commence, there are various factors that drive people to relocate to metropolitan areas. The allure of job opportunities attracts a significant influx of individuals seeking a more luxurious lifestyle. Moreover, parents aspire to provide their children with better educational prospects and opportunities for personal growth. Consequently, governments have embarked on extensive construction projects to accommodate the growing demand for housing. For instance, in today's Ha Noi, virtually every nook and cranny is adorned with buildings and apartments, addressing the housing needs of city dwellers.\nNevertheless, residing in compact homes without outdoor spaces carries adverse consequences. First and foremost, children are deprived of adequate areas for recreation and amusement, particularly when their parents are occupied with work. Consequently, youngsters tend to spend an excessive amount of time watching television and playing video games, neglecting their physical well-being. Secondly, due to the limited living space, coupled with the absence of balconies in many homes, residents are deprived of the refreshing presence of greenery. As an illustration, a green environment and access to fresh air can swiftly dispel negative emotions within our homes.\nIn conclusion, I steadfastly maintain the viewpoint that this issue will have a lasting impact on future generations, affecting both their mental and physical well-being. To counteract these negative effects, we can engage in activities such as yoga and meditation, which can help mitigate the challenges posed by the limited outdoor space.\n"

      "paragraph": "While many argue about the drawbacks and benefits of whether scientific studies should be conducted and overseen by private corporations instead of the government, from my perspective, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.\nOn the one hand, the benefits of private companies taking charge of research are quite significant. The most substantial and recognizable gain is the swift availability of funds for scientists to conduct experiments, thereby delivering quicker results to society. For instance, consider the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which terrorized billions of people worldwide. In such a catastrophic crisis, an optimal solution must be established as soon as possible. If the government were the sole source for instilling vaccines or preventive procedures, thousands of families could have lost their loved ones.\nOn the other hand, scientific research managed by the government also has its merits. First and foremost, all studies are conducted solely for the public's well-being. For example, preventive medicines are not produced for profit but to enhance people's health and ensure environmental protection. Moreover, while many companies keep their research findings private, the government's discoveries, on the contrary, are accessible to everyone.\nIn conclusion, the debate continues regarding the efficiency of whether scientific research should be controlled by companies rather than governments.

      "paragraph": "It is sometimes believed that it is significant for businesses to make a profit while also being responsible for social obligations. I completely agree with this idea. This essay will discuss several reasons in support of my perspective.\nOn the one hand, there are also a handful of arguments in favor of the idea that companies making money is the priority. Firstly, companies earn money to pay taxes imposed by the government, so the money that the government receives from taxes can then be distributed to public buildings, including hospitals, schools, and nursing homes. This means that they can provide a life full of conveniences for citizens. Additionally, enterprises generate more job opportunities for citizens, helping them to support their personal lives.\nOn the other hand, there are also some reasons why enterprises should be responsible for social duties. One possible purpose is that corporations must not cause environmental degradation. For example, carbon-intensive industries lead to global warming, which is irresponsible of humans. Therefore, a system to deal with waste and make it safe can be installed, along with raising human consciousness. Furthermore, businesses can contribute money to the community through charity and scholarships. For instance, Vinamilk is a business that pays much attention to social responsibility activities, in addition to focusing on investing in economic activities to create quality products and environmentally friendly sustainable development.\nIn conclusion, I totally agree with businesses being responsible to the outside community. In addition to making money, businesses should participate in social activities to develop in parallel.\n"

      "paragraph": "The question of whether students should explore a variety of subjects alongside their primary area of study is a topic of ongoing debate. Some argue that concentrating solely on obtaining a qualification should take precedence. In this essay, we will examine the advantages of both exclusive focus on one subject and broadening one's horizons with diverse coursework at the university. Personally, I believe that a balanced approach, which incorporates both elements, is the most advantageous.\nFocusing exclusively on one subject is believed to offer certain benefits. It can help students achieve a high level of expertise in that specific area and minimize distractions. A prime example of this is the field of medicine, renowned for its demanding nature, extensive study hours, and intense concentration required. Trying to simultaneously excel in both medicine and business studies can pose challenges to achieving proficiency in either. Additionally, dedicating oneself to a single subject may alleviate a significant amount of stress. Enrolling in too many courses can overwhelm students, particularly during exam seasons when they must prepare for various subjects. Meanwhile, students who concentrate on a single course can allocate more time to spend with their families or take care of themselves since they only have one subject to focus on. While it is argued that studying a variety of subjects offers more versatility, the increased stress and limited personal time may compromise overall well-being.\nNonetheless, there are compelling reasons why gaining knowledge in a range of subjects provides distinct advantages. Taking multiple courses allows students to develop in various ways, enhancing their post-graduation job prospects, particularly in this modern era when major corporations require employees to excel in multiple skills. For instance, office workers not only need qualifications in their respective fields but also must master information technology skills and be fluent in English or another language. These skills can be acquired through university classes.\nIn conclusion, students should consider studying different subjects at university. I firmly believe that they should also engage in additional activities, such as charitable endeavors and the cultivation of soft skills, to broaden their knowledge and thereby strengthen their prospects for a promising future career.\n"

      "paragraph": "There is a widely held belief that traffic and pollution issues would be best tackled by increasing fuel prices. In my opinion, this belief is flawed, and there are several reasonable alternatives.\nOn one hand, the idea of reducing the price of fuel may contribute to the betterment of the environment. One of these benefits is related to raising public awareness. People may consider using public transportation or eco-friendly vehicles since using private cars could become expensive. This change in behavior might have a profound effect on the transportation network and our planet. It can ease traffic flow, resulting in a reduction in greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, and an improvement in air quality. For example, in Vietnam, the authorities have implemented policies to increase gas taxes, encouraging people to use public transportation instead of private vehicles. This has proven effective and brings benefits to both individuals and the environment, even though it may not be a long-term solution.\nWhile many people believe that increasing fuel prices is the most successful solution, it cannot be denied that environmental issues have multiple causes. For instance, many industrial factories release a host of pollutants daily, posing a significant threat to air quality. Another example is that individuals frequently clear land and cut down trees for housing or agricultural purposes, which harms the natural habitats of flora and fauna. Therefore, alternative approaches to raising petrol prices may prove more effective.\nFirstly, if the government were to impose stricter regulations on private vehicle usage and focus on improving public transportation, it could reduce road congestion and increase the number of public transportation users. Additionally, creating separate zones for cyclists during rush hours could alleviate traffic overload, preventing it from exceeding the road's capacity.\nIn conclusion, I believe that increasing fuel prices alone is not sufficient to address traffic and environmental issues. Additional methods should be adopted to tackle the multifaceted nature of these problems.\n"

From my perspective, I completely agree that the government has a significant responsibility to address this pressing issue. There are several effective ways for the government to reduce the number of children with obesity.\nFirst and foremost, the government should introduce subjects related to nutrition and health into the school curriculum. This would help raise awareness among students about the importance of maintaining good health. For instance, teachers can incorporate lessons on the nutritional pyramid, healthy lifestyles, and the harmful effects of a sedentary lifestyle on our bodies. These lessons would enrich their knowledge about the importance of staying healthy.\nAnother effective measure is for governments to regulate and control the number of restaurants and advertisements promoting fast food, which is a major contributor to the problem of overweight and unhealthy lifestyles among children.\nAdditionally, governments should invest in the construction of sports facilities such as gyms and football pitches to provide more opportunities for children to engage in physical activities.\nI also strongly believe that it is not solely the responsibility of the government; parents and caregivers also have a crucial role to play in ensuring the health of their children. One solution for parents is to purchase nutritious foods like salmon and eggs to enhance their children's health. Furthermore, parents should actively encourage their children to participate in outdoor activities, such as exercise or sports. For example, children can enroll in sports courses based on their interests or engage in physical activities with their parents.\nIn conclusion, the government plays a pivotal role in addressing the issue of childhood health, but it should be supported by the active involvement of parents and caregivers. By taking these steps, we can work together to combat childhood obesity and promote healthier lifestyles for our children.\n"

In my opinion, this trend is a detrimental development, and there are several compelling reasons to support this perspective.\nFirst and foremost, the migration of rural individuals can have significant adverse effects on social and welfare issues. For instance, the influx of city-bound customers seeking high-quality goods can result in shortages of these products for those who cannot afford them immediately. Additionally, there can be a substantial increase in criminal activities in various forms. In cities like Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam, authorities grapple with issues such as pickpocketing and theft from jewelry stores. This surge in crime rates can be attributed to the rising unemployment caused by overcrowding in urban areas.\nFurthermore, urban facilities such as education, healthcare, and transportation may experience disruptions. Residents may find themselves enduring long waiting times and providing extensive personal information to access essential services. Cultural clashes can also be a significant problem, leading to conflicts. For example, the misunderstandings and debates between long-time residents and newcomers in my area highlight the cultural tensions that can arise.\nIn conclusion, the rapid and uncontrollable increase in the urban population due to the migration of rural residents can result in numerous disadvantages.

However, I argue that a clear dress code can indeed have an impact on the quality of work by ensuring safety, enhancing the company's image, and promoting a cohesive work environment.\nFirstly, having specific clothing requirements that match the nature of the job and ensure employee safety can increase productivity and work quality. For example, when employees wear safety gear like goggles or helmets on construction sites, they can prevent potential accidents. In this regard, emphasizing dress code rules reduces risks and improves the overall well-being of the staff, which can directly affect the quality of their work. Furthermore, when employees feel safe, they can contribute confidently to their work goals, potentially leading to a significant improvement in productivity.\nAnother reason for having a dress code is its importance in shaping the company's image. Take airlines like Emirates, for instance. Their strict dress code for employees contributes to their premium and professional brand image, which, in turn, builds customer trust and satisfaction. This trust results in repeat business and referrals, ultimately having a positive impact on the quality of work. Additionally, having a dress code instills a sense of pride in employees who see themselves as representatives of the brand. This pride fosters better collaboration among team members and a shared commitment to delivering excellent service, which, in turn, improves the quality of work.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that employers should consider dress codes in the workplace, as the importance of a dress code at work depends on the nature of the profession, improvements in the company's reputation, and the sense of pride it instills in employees.\n"

However, I firmly disagree with this notion, as I believe that achieving success in life demands a multifaceted approach that involves gaining knowledge from diverse sources and gaining practical experience.\nFirst and foremost, acquiring knowledge from various individuals is crucial for success. When people share their perspectives and ideas, it enriches our understanding and equips us with valuable insights that can guide us in making informed decisions. Recent research supports this idea, demonstrating that collaboration and teamwork significantly enhance the chances of success. Working in a group setting allows individuals to openly communicate, learn from their past mistakes, and avoid repeating them.\nFurthermore, accumulating practical experience is essential for achieving success. While theoretical knowledge provides a solid foundation, it is the application of that knowledge in real-life situations that truly matters. Many successful individuals have faced challenges early in their careers and persevered until they achieved their desired outcomes. These experiences are invaluable and contribute significantly to their success.\nIn conclusion, success in the future requires more than just focusing on a single skill.

While there are some clear advantages to this viewpoint, I would argue that the disadvantages outweigh the benefits.\nAdmittedly, there is a significant advantage when private companies engage in scientific research, primarily related to the economy. Private companies typically have a strong financial foundation, allowing them to invest substantial sums of money in research. Additionally, they can provide immediate funding when necessary. For example, during emergencies like the development of a vaccine to combat the coronavirus, many private companies had the financial resources to invest in research promptly.\nHowever, I believe that the drawbacks of this approach are more substantial for several reasons. When the government is responsible for research, it offers significant benefits to public well-being. While private companies may invest their funds in potentially harmful or risky research, the government is obligated to prioritize research projects that benefit public health and are non-profit in nature, such as preventive medicine or environmental protection. Furthermore, research findings conducted by governments are not kept secret; they can be shared with scientists and governments worldwide, facilitating quicker advancements.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the disadvantages of private companies conducting and controlling scientific research outweigh the advantages.

From my perspective, I strongly agree that the disadvantages of this trend far outweigh its benefits.\nFirst and foremost, the growing number of beauty contests is likely to lower the standard of beauty queens. This means that with numerous beauty competitions being held annually, judges and sponsors cannot thoroughly evaluate the qualities of beauty, resulting in a decrease in the overall quality and effectiveness of the competitors. Consequently, this leads to a loss of appeal in beauty contests. For example, research conducted by Central Queensland University suggests that Vietnamese individuals found beauty competitions in 2022 to be tedious compared to those held in 2010 due to excessive organization and a lack of entertainment.\nOn the other hand, it is clear that such trends can have a significant impact on people's thinking and behavior. Since beauty queens have a substantial influence on the public, they serve as role models for individuals, especially the youth. If beauty queens engage in charitable activities to help disadvantaged people after beauty contests, individuals are more likely to donate and follow their lead. However, consider the case of Doan Thien An, a beauty queen in Miss Universe Vietnam 2022. She shared a variety of inaccurate information about history and social issues on social media and with the public, which has a negative impact on our future generation.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that an excessive number of beauty contests can detrimentally affect the quality and entertainment value of the candidates.

You have the authority to make decisions about everything, from work methods and strategies to your own resting time. Furthermore, you can fully enjoy all the profits you earn, which means you have control over how to manage or spend your income.\nEven though freelancing offers the freedom to make your own decisions, there are still risks and challenges to consider. First, when your business becomes inundated with contracts and transactions, it can lead to stress and mental health issues. Imagine a scenario where you have an overwhelming workload and projects piling up, but you're physically and mentally exhausted. This situation can result in mental health problems, unfinished work, and dissatisfied customers. Moreover, some individuals may struggle with the isolation that comes with freelancing, which can exacerbate their stress and inner health issues.\nAnother significant drawback is the lack of guaranteed steady monthly income over the long term. For instance, some business ventures may require taking risks to start and operate. Additionally, there is no assigned mentor or guide to assist you with projects or plans. Once you veer off the original path, it can be challenging to get back on track.\nIn conclusion, this approach to entrepreneurship has its pros and cons. While it grants individuals the freedom to manage their time and income, they must carefully consider the potential difficulties to avoid unfortunate incidents. I believe that freelancers and self-employed individuals can benefit from a more informed and intelligent perspective, which will help them achieve success more easily.\n"

      "paragraph": "These days, affluent nations often provide financial assistance to less prosperous countries in an attempt to combat poverty. However, this approach has not yielded the desired results. Some argue that developed countries should explore alternative means of aiding impoverished nations, a viewpoint with which I wholeheartedly agree.\nOne compelling reason for my agreement with the notion that affluent nations should seek alternative ways to assist poorer countries is the possibility that the recipients may not effectively allocate the funds. When wealthier nations extend monetary support to struggling countries, such as those in Africa, there is a risk that the money might be spent without a clear plan for sustainable development. Due to the relatively low levels of literacy in many of these regions, the funds are often expended primarily on immediate needs, such as food and water. Consequently, the financial aid is quickly exhausted, leaving these nations trapped in the cycle of poverty. This predicament is not unique to Africa but is a common occurrence in various underdeveloped countries.\nAnother compelling rationale for my agreement is the potential to create employment opportunities for the inhabitants of these impoverished nations. Providing jobs and opportunities for stable income can have a far-reaching positive impact. When individuals have gainful employment, they can earn salaries that support a stable and sustainable lifestyle, alleviating their concerns about unemployment. This approach can significantly benefit a vast number of people across different nations. Moreover, wealthier nations can contribute to environmental efforts by sending volunteers to reforest regions that have suffered from wildfires, simultaneously addressing environmental challenges while aiding poorer countries.\nIn conclusion, I am in full agreement with the perspective that addressing poverty in underdeveloped countries necessitates richer nations exploring alternative avenues of assistance. Rather than simply providing financial aid, they should consider strategies that empower these nations to make sustainable progress toward a brighter future.\n"

      "paragraph": "The world's population is progressively aging. It is indeed true that many elderly individuals are opting to reside in retirement communities alongside peers instead of living with their adult children. From my perspective, this trend brings about favorable outcomes for both the elderly individuals and their offspring.\nFirst and foremost, the most significant benefit of living with peers in retirement communities is the alleviation of feelings of loneliness. To elaborate, when older people become part of these communities, they have the opportunity to socialize with fellow adults. Consequently, they do not experience loneliness or isolation. Moreover, in retirement communities, elderly individuals can easily connect with others who share similar interests, allowing them to engage in activities together. For instance, my uncle's family serves as a relevant example. Due to their demanding work schedules, they are unable to devote sufficient time to caring for my grandparents, prompting them to opt for a nursing home.\nSecondly, their health conditions can be regularly monitored, and these facilities offer adequate support during their stay in retirement homes. To exemplify, nursing homes are equipped with the necessary medical equipment and essential amenities to enhance the well-being of seniors during their stay. For instance, it has been reported that elderly residents in retirement communities receive daily health check-ups and have access to state-of-the-art facilities to enhance their health, thereby benefiting their mental and physical well-being.\nIn conclusion, living with peers in retirement communities brings about advantageous impacts on both senior citizens and the lives of their children. It achieves this by diminishing the loneliness experienced by the elderly and providing access to good healthcare services and modern facilities.\n"

      "paragraph": "Many individuals propose that governments should enact laws governing citizens' food choices as a means to combat unhealthy eating habits. I strongly disagree with this notion when it comes to personal preferences.\nOn one hand, implementing legislation regarding food consumption could potentially promote a healthier diet. Lawmakers could establish recommended daily nutritional intake guidelines, as advised by nutritionists, and eliminate unhealthy food items, such as heavily processed products, from the list of available options. Those who do not adhere to these guidelines might face minor fines, while companies selling unapproved products could be prohibited from operating. These measures could encourage citizens to adopt a well-balanced diet, which is scientifically proven to be essential for overall well-being.\nOn the other hand, a law regulating people's food choices is unlikely to cater to everyone's individual needs. Indeed, a person's food selection for a meal is influenced by various personal factors, including taste preferences, nutritional requirements, and financial constraints. Some individuals may opt for a meal at a fast-food restaurant like McDonald's, possibly because they enjoy cheesy beef patties or because it's the most affordable option, especially when special offers are available. Moreover, I do not believe it is the government's role to prevent people from indulging in occasional guilty pleasures. Therefore, in my opinion, imposing strict dietary guidelines on everyone is ethically questionable and fails to address the diverse needs and rights of individuals within a society.\nIn conclusion, while governmental oversight of dietary choices may promote a more scientifically sound diet, I firmly believe that individuals should have the freedom to consume foods of their choosing. Instead of enforcing laws, health ministries should focus on conducting nationwide campaigns to promote healthy eating habits.\n"

While this inclination does come with certain drawbacks, I am of the opinion that the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.\nIt is understandable why some individuals opt to avoid risks. Firstly, they may desire a stable and tranquil life. This is because taking risks can lead to financial and relationship losses, both of which are crucial aspects of anyone's life. Additionally, making sacrifices becomes necessary when embarking on risky endeavors. For instance, those aiming to advance their careers may find themselves with less time for their family and loved ones.\nDespite the aforementioned arguments, I firmly believe that taking risks can create opportunities that can profoundly transform people's lives. It should be acknowledged that stepping out of one's comfort zone can broaden horizons, offering a fresh perspective. This is because when confronted with obstacles and challenges, individuals can discover their strengths and weaknesses, while also acquiring new skills that contribute to their success. This argument is further supported by the fact that many successful individuals achieve wealth precisely because they are willing to take risks, such as starting businesses or investing in stocks. Only through taking risks can people experience significant personal and professional growth.\nIn conclusion, while it is true to some extent that risks may lead to negative consequences, I maintain that embracing risks is the only pathway to success, as it enables individuals to acquire new skills and explore a wealth of opportunities.\"\n"

In this essay, I will discuss various factors contributing to environmental problems and propose measures that governments and individuals can adopt to combat them.\nNumerous factors contribute to environmental damage, with two major threats being air pollution and excessive waste generation. Factories and vehicles emit hazardous gases that pollute the air. Additionally, the excessive consumption of consumer goods results in increased waste production. This waste not only contaminates the Earth but also pollutes rivers and oceans.\nGovernments can play a crucial role in addressing these issues by implementing environmental laws and regulations. These laws should apply to all types of factories, particularly those that contribute to air pollution, such as the automobile and airline industries. Instead of focusing on corporate taxes, governments should prioritize \"green taxes.\" Furthermore, investing in public transportation facilities can encourage people to reduce their reliance on private vehicles.\nIndividuals, too, should shoulder responsibility for their environmental impact. Opting for public transportation over private vehicles is one way they can contribute. Moreover, individuals can take additional steps to protect the environment. Firstly, they can choose products with reusable and recyclable attributes. Secondly, they can decline plastic bags when offered while shopping and promote the use of paper or cloth bags. It's crucial for people to recognize that responsible consumption is the way forward. Through reuse, recycling, and the avoidance of plastic, we can effectively reduce waste.\nIn conclusion, both governments and individuals must actively participate in environmental protection and fulfill their respective roles in addressing this pressing issue.\n"

While this viewpoint has certain drawbacks related to time consumption and stress, the overall advantages significantly outweigh the disadvantages for both individuals and society.\nOn one hand, a notable drawback is the significant time commitment that unpaid work demands. Young individuals often struggle to allocate time for community service alongside their academic studies or job commitments. This limitation leaves them with insufficient time for leisure and relaxation. For instance, students at my university are mandated to acquire soft skills like presentation, group work, and informatics in addition to their regular coursework, which consumes a substantial portion of their time. This places additional stress on their time management for volunteer activities.\nOn the other hand, despite the aforementioned negative impact, the benefits of motivating young people to assist those in need are considerably more substantial for both the youth and the community. When individuals willingly contribute to their community, they gain valuable experiences that can significantly enhance their future careers. Many employers highly value applicants with practical experience related to their field of study. For example, undergraduate students majoring in English education can serve as tutors for underprivileged children, gaining hands-on experience that enriches their teaching careers. Simultaneously, these children receive basic education, making a positive impact on local education. Consequently, these individuals become well-qualified for their future jobs and can contribute not only to their personal growth but also to the betterment of their community.\nIn conclusion, despite the potential negative effects on young people engaging in volunteer work to assist those in need, the long-term benefits for these individuals should be given more consideration.

Although I concur that scientific research should be initiated and influenced by corporations, I still hold the belief that it should be controlled by private companies.\nThere are valid reasons why the government should undertake and manage scientific research. Firstly, governments can allocate funds directly from national taxes to support scientists and researchers. Secondly, some governments solely pursue profits. For instance, a company might develop a vaccine for the coronavirus but sell it at a high price, which can be detrimental to individuals who cannot afford it. In contrast, scientific studies overseen by the government would be reliable and minimize fraudulent activities.\nNevertheless, non-governmental companies typically offer substantial financial incentives to expedite research. This practice helps them attract more skilled and proficient scientists to collaborate with them. For example, if they offer a substantial sum to scientists to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus, researchers would work swiftly, potentially safeguarding the public from the pandemic. However, non-governmental companies primarily focus on maximizing their profits rather than promoting societal welfare.\nIn conclusion, I believe that scientific research should be undertaken by both the government and private companies.\n"

      "paragraph": "Many people hold the belief that reading books is superior for enhancing imagination and language skills when compared to watching TV. I wholeheartedly agree with this viewpoint, and I will elucidate my reasons below.\nOn one hand, reading books enables individuals to nurture their creativity more effectively than watching TV. It is an indisputable fact that words empower readers to form mental images of the content they read, with no bounds on their imaginative faculties. For instance, if a hundred different people read the book \"One Thousand and One Nights\" simultaneously, they can potentially conjure up a hundred distinct interpretations of Aladdin, the story's main character. Conversely, when a hundred people collectively watch the TV adaptation of \"Aladdin,\" their subsequent mental image of the character will invariably be influenced by the portrayal of Mena Massoud. This illustrates that reading books surpasses watching TV in terms of its capacity to stimulate one's imagination.\nOn the other hand, watching TV plays a crucial role in the acquisition of language skills, as opposed to reading books. This is exemplified by the fact that TV, with its audio-visual components, has the potential to assist viewers in honing their listening and speaking abilities, thereby enhancing their language comprehension. A compelling case in point is Khanh Vy, a highly renowned teenager in Vietnam known for her linguistic prowess. She is a remarkable polyglot, proficient in six languages, including English, Chinese, Japanese, French, Italian, and German. During an interview with Forbes last year, she divulged that she dedicates approximately five hours daily to watching foreign-language films without subtitles. She firmly believes that this is the most effective method for individuals, especially young ones, to learn new languages.\nIn conclusion, it is my firm belief that people should prioritize reading books as a means to cultivate their imagination and linguistic skills, rather than opting for television. This stance is grounded in the two aforementioned reasons.\n"

I vehemently disagree with this notion because I firmly believe that we should endeavor to help as many people as possible.\nOn one hand, I acknowledge the importance of aiding our neighbors and fellow citizens. It is undeniable that poverty and disadvantage exist in virtually all communities to some extent. Even in the most prosperous cities, homelessness remains a visible problem. Therefore, there are ample opportunities for volunteering or making donations to assist those who are concerned about these issues. In the United Kingdom, there are various ways to contribute, ranging from donating clothes to serving meals at soup kitchens. Given that these problems are happening right on our doorsteps and are multi-faceted, I can comprehend why some individuals argue that focusing on local charitable efforts should suffice.\nSimultaneously, I contend that providing assistance to people residing beyond our nation's borders is equally essential. Many countries around the world are grappling with pressing issues that require immediate support, often more dire than the challenges faced by local communities. For instance, in some African countries, children are dying from preventable diseases. Governments and individuals in wealthier nations have the capacity to save lives by funding the purchase of existing vaccines. A modest donation to international charities can have a far-reaching impact compared to local volunteer activities.\nIn conclusion, it is impractical to provide assistance to every person in need, but in my perspective, national boundaries should not be a barrier to extending a helping hand to those who require it.\n"

There are various reasons for this perspective, and potential solutions can help address these negative attitudes.\nSome people harbor negative views about international tourism for several reasons. The primary concern is the fear of disease outbreaks. With global travel, there is a heightened risk of diseases spreading across borders, which can adversely affect the health of residents in host countries. Take, for instance, the case of SAR-CoV2. Due to the free movement across borders, the Coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, spread rapidly around the world. This has heightened anxiety among residents in countries famous for tourism. Another factor contributing to negative perceptions is the disrespectful behavior of tourists towards the cultural values and codes of conduct of the host countries. Some tourists may expect the local culture to be disregarded for their convenience when they visit another country. For example, in Vietnam, some travelers wear inappropriate clothing or expose too much skin when visiting historical sites, leading to negative sentiments among the local population.\nTo address these issues, effective measures should be implemented. The first solution involves governments taking decisive actions to limit the spread of pandemics and protect the local community from dangerous diseases. This can include implementing epidemic prevention measures, health declaration procedures, and quarantines when there are signs of symptoms. Such measures would make people feel safer in their own countries. Another noteworthy approach is for the Vietnam Tourism Association to promote tourism policies that emphasize cultural exchange. Specifically, they should widely publicize programs that encourage visitors to engage in respectful cultural exchanges when exploring a new country. This approach focuses on respecting local culture so that tourists will behave appropriately and avoid actions that offend local people, ultimately reducing negative opinions about international tourism.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that several significant issues have arisen due to the growth of international tourism.

While some may view this as a positive trend, I believe its impact should be evaluated in specific contexts, which I will discuss in this essay.\nTo begin with, the increasing demand for workers in urban areas makes it a reasonable choice for rural residents to migrate to cities, provided that there is a well-thought-out government policy in place. In today's world, businesses require a substantial workforce to perform various tasks. Consequently, this presents a favorable opportunity for individuals from rural backgrounds to explore job prospects and advance in their careers. This phenomenon is in line with the broader trend observed in many cities, both nationally and globally.\nConversely, if this migration lacks proper planning and oversight from the authorities, it may result in what is known as spontaneous urbanization, which can spiral out of control. This can lead to significant consequences such as job shortages, housing problems, and public security concerns. Urbanization can indeed offer improved educational opportunities, but this hinges on the migrants possessing the necessary skills and qualifications. For instance, if a large influx of people moves to cities without carefully considering their options, it can lead to a shortage of housing and various other resources. Perhaps, if the authorities in rural areas were to enhance the quality of life for their citizens, individuals might be more inclined to stay in their hometowns rather than migrate to cities.\nIn conclusion, the movement of people from rural to urban areas is not inherently negative; however, it is crucial to strike a balance and implement effective government planning to ensure that the consequences of this shift are positive rather than detrimental.\n"

While reading undeniably offers its own benefits, interactive experiences provide distinct advantages. In this essay, I will elucidate my reasons with the aid of some examples.\nFirst and foremost, it is essential to acknowledge the vital role that reading plays in a child's development. Reading promotes language proficiency, expands vocabulary, and stimulates imagination. It can instill a love for learning, enhance concentration, and foster critical thinking skills. For instance, a child who takes a keen interest in reading has a more agile brain compared to an average child. Furthermore, cultivating a reading habit encourages children to sharpen their focus. This is because the time children spend reading necessitates concentrated effort to assimilate knowledge from the page into their minds. Repeating this process multiple times cultivates the ability to concentrate effectively.\nOn the flip side, participation in activities can bolster a child's coordination, self-confidence, and offer ample opportunities to form new friendships. Activities such as playing sports, solving puzzles, or engaging in group projects in clubs facilitate the development of both fine and gross motor skills, which are indispensable for various life tasks. Additionally, interactive activities nurture creativity and problem-solving skills. When children participate in hands-on activities, they learn to experiment and devise creative solutions. For instance, games involving model-building, puzzle-solving, or imaginative play encourage the exploration of ideas and the cultivation of innovative thinking.\nIn conclusion, I believe that while reading fosters cognitive development, enjoyable activities play a pivotal role in honing practical life skills. To meet the demands of the contemporary generation, children should actively engage in activities that enhance their creativity and soft skills.\n"

This essay will explore both perspectives and present my viewpoint.\nSome argue that manufacturers and supermarkets can significantly influence how products are packaged and should shoulder the responsibility for reducing excessive packaging. Proponents of this view contend that numerous companies and supermarkets must limit and minimize the use of harmful and slow-to-decompose packaging materials. The extended decomposition period of such materials can have severe consequences for the environment and people's health. Additionally, it is argued that reducing and limiting packaging can lead to cost savings for customers. For instance, when companies opt for luxurious or plastic packaging, they incur significant expenses, ultimately resulting in higher product prices for consumers.\nHowever, I maintain the belief that customers themselves can play a crucial role in reducing packaging usage. One key approach is for customers to prioritize environmentally-friendly packaging options and actively limit the disposal of packaging waste into the environment. For instance, in Vietnam, the adoption of more eco-friendly packaging alternatives has led to a substantial 30% reduction in discarded plastic. Furthermore, consumer choices and preferences can influence manufacturers to opt for packaging materials that protect the environment and promote public health.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that both manufacturers and customers should share the responsibility of minimizing excessive packaging in consumer goods.

This essay will examine some primary reasons for this phenomenon and suggest potential solutions to address these pressing issues.\nThere are several significant reasons contributing to the extinction of animal species. Firstly, deforestation poses a substantial threat to terrestrial species. Vast expanses of rainforests have been cleared to accommodate the growing demand for land, needed for factories, industrial zones, and residences. This makes it challenging for some species to find new habitats and adapt to unfamiliar environments, placing them at a higher risk of extinction. Another factor driving animal extinction is the impact of tourism in coastal areas, which has a detrimental effect on marine ecosystems as waste discharge contaminates the water. Additionally, oil spills resulting from the process of oil extraction and ship collisions can rapidly eliminate numerous aquatic creatures.\nNevertheless, there are several actions that could be undertaken to alleviate these problems. Foremost, governments should implement stricter penalties to deter irresponsible actions such as illegal logging and the improper disposal of chemical waste. Furthermore, authorities should initiate public awareness campaigns to educate people about environmental conservation. For instance, they can disseminate information about animal protection through the internet and social media platforms.

While some people advocate for encouraging competitiveness in children, I firmly believe that imparting cooperation skills can lead to their betterment as adults.\nTo begin with, a competitive mindset often leads us to focus solely on ourselves. This constant comparison can result in a sense of inadequacy when we inevitably encounter individuals who excel in various aspects of life. Furthermore, an excessive emphasis on competition can nurture selfish tendencies in children. Instead of striving to become the best version of themselves, they may fixate on surpassing others. Additionally, an overly competitive attitude may hinder their ability to sympathize and empathize with those around them, as they become preoccupied with winning and overlook the joy of caring for others.\nOn the contrary, another approach to nurturing well-rounded individuals is by teaching them the importance of collaboration. In today's world, teamwork is undeniably crucial, as people increasingly value the kindness and support of others over individual talents. Learning to collaborate allows individuals to establish mutually beneficial relationships where everyone can improve together. Furthermore, this fosters healthier mentalities, leading to increased happiness.

Many future parents have demanding jobs and busy schedules, and they may not possess the willingness or flexibility to attend regular parenting classes. This raises the question of how those who miss or decline the classes would be dealt with. I firmly believe that penalizing them would be unjust, rendering the enforcement of mandatory parental training infeasible. Furthermore, even if parents were coerced into attending, I question whether consensus could be reached on what constitutes effective parenting, making it arduous to devise a universally suitable parenting course.\nIn addition to its impracticality, I contend that parental training courses are superfluous. Throughout history, mothers and fathers have been rearing children without any formal assistance or official interference. Parenting skills are acquired from interactions with family members, friends, neighbors, and the surrounding culture. Moreover, adults naturally learn to be proficient parents through instinct, trial and error, and by developing an understanding of their own children. For example, a competent parent will experiment with various approaches when dealing with a misbehaving child, gradually honing their ability to rectify the behavior. None of these processes necessitates formal instruction.\nIn conclusion, while mandatory parenting lessons may initially appear beneficial, I am convinced that such a scheme would be unviable and largely devoid of purpose.\n"

They compel themselves to study in confined spaces with computers, books, and lessons, driven by their parents' expectations. Consequently, a sedentary lifestyle predisposes children to physical problems such as malnutrition and internal organ dysfunction. Moreover, they grapple with peer pressure and academic performance-related stress, which can lead to negative emotions like anxiety, fatigue, and school-related fears, ultimately contributing to various mental health issues. Therefore, it is imperative for parents to encourage their children to allocate sufficient time to physical activities, thereby ensuring a well-rounded and healthy life for their offspring.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that parents should reduce study time and promote physical activities for their children, as this approach facilitates holistic growth, maintaining a harmonious balance between learning and overall well-being.\n"

      "question": "To what extent do you agree with the writer's opinion that compulsory parenting courses are unnecessary?",
      "paragraph": "It is indeed true that parents today bear a significant responsibility, and the task of raising children is undeniably challenging. However, I wholeheartedly concur with the notion that all mothers and fathers should be encouraged to participate in courses designed to help them become better parents.\nIn my perspective, mandating parents to enroll in parenthood preparation courses could be deemed impractical. Nowadays, most prospective parents find themselves engrossed in their careers, leaving them with limited time or inclination to commit to such courses. Should they neglect these classes or express reluctance to attend, imposing penalties appears unjustifiable. Furthermore, even if they were to agree to participate in such courses, concerns arise regarding their alignment with the principles espoused in these programs. Consequently, it proves challenging to make such courses obligatory for all mothers and fathers.\nBeyond the impracticality, I hold the belief that parental training courses are superfluous. Over millennia, parents have successfully nurtured their offspring without formal instruction or external intervention. Proficiency in parenting is often passed down through generations and acquired through familial, social, and communal networks. Furthermore, adults possess an innate capacity to be effective parents, learning through their own experiences, experimentation, and a willingness to adapt. Many parents employ diverse strategies when faced with a misbehaving child, eventually honing their ability to rectify such behavior. In this light, formal courses appear unnecessary.\nIn conclusion, while the idea of organizing such courses may initially appear commendable, I am inclined to view it as both unworkable and redundant.\n"

      "paragraph": "In the context of a thriving cultural exchange, individuals tend to explore and engage with various fascinating cultures. There is a belief that people can acquire profound insights into cultures through books, documents, films, and the Internet without the need for travel. I wholeheartedly disagree with this assertion, and this essay will outline my perspectives on the matter.\nFirst and foremost, traveling offers a plethora of unique benefits that cannot be gleaned from any form of information, such as books, news, or films. Through travel, individuals have the opportunity to immerse themselves in culture in the most authentic, intuitive, and vibrant manner. Furthermore, there are countless aspects of culture that can only be truly understood through firsthand experience, as they are influenced by individual perspectives, lifestyles, and personal preferences. For instance, Chinese cuisine may not appeal to the tastes of Americans, but it may be an exquisite culinary delight for Vietnamese individuals.\nAnother critical consideration is the objectivity of books, films, and online news sources. Each document, authored by different individuals, serves a specific purpose and is heavily influenced by the author's viewpoint. Consequently, some accounts of particular places may be biased or embellished to boost local tourism, even when the actual conditions do not align with the descriptions provided. Similarly, television programs that promote tourism often present a carefully curated and positive image of destinations while concealing their shortcomings.\nTaking all factors into account, I firmly advocate for the practical experience of culture through travel. Through travel, people can gain the most genuine understanding of diverse cultures and connect with their own emotions in a way that no book, film, or internet source can replicate.\n"

      "paragraph": "Many individuals debate whether high school students should be encouraged to question and offer criticisms about their teachers to enhance educational quality. Conversely, some argue that this approach may erode respect and discipline in the classroom. I strongly support the idea of allowing students to express their opinions and question their teachers, as I believe it fosters an ideal classroom environment.\nDetractors of this proposal argue that teachers deserve respect and that constant interruptions from students can hinder effective teaching, including delivering lectures, assigning homework, and grading assignments. They contend that some students might exploit a culture that encourages questioning to disrupt lessons deliberately and undermine the authority of the teacher. Additionally, there is a concern that negative attitudes among students could lead to general unrest, which is not conducive to productive learning. However, I would counter that the appearance of respect, often maintained through silence in the classroom, may hold little real value beyond preserving unfounded pride.\nFurthermore, open discussions and the free exchange of ideas are fundamental to optimal learning experiences. Students who sit quietly, feigning interest in class, are likely to lose motivation over time. Conversely, when a class is studying a piece of literature or a historical event, students become more engaged when they have the opportunity to ask questions. These questions, even if framed as criticisms of the subject matter, provide students with a meaningful reason to learn, making the lesson more memorable for everyone. Moreover, these inquiries can lead to unique insights and collaborative exploration if the teacher is confident enough to facilitate such discussions.\nIn conclusion, while certain educational institutions may fear that encouraging questions from students could undermine teachers, I believe that questions are the cornerstone of a positive learning environment. Schools should embrace academic rigor in all its forms, including constructive student feedback and inquiries.\n"

I strongly disagree with this perspective because I firmly believe that we should endeavor to assist as many people as we can.\nOn one hand, I acknowledge the importance of assisting our fellow citizens and neighbors. Most communities, in one way or another, have individuals facing poverty or disadvantage. It's evident that even in the healthiest of cities, there are homeless individuals in need of assistance. Therefore, there are ample opportunities for volunteering and donating to address these local issues. In the UK, there are various ways to offer help, ranging from donating clothes to serving free meals at soup kitchens. Given that these problems are happening right at our doorstep, it is understandable why some argue that focusing on local charitable efforts should suffice.\nHowever, I firmly believe that extending assistance to people beyond our national borders is equally important. Many countries around the world are grappling with urgent and dire situations that far exceed the problems faced by local communities. For instance, in some African countries, children are dying from preventable diseases. In such cases, governments and individuals in more prosperous nations can save lives by contributing to the purchase of vaccines or making compact donations to international charities. Such contributions can have a far-reaching impact compared to local volunteer activities.\nIn conclusion, it is impractical to provide aid to all individuals in need worldwide.

      "paragraph": "In contemporary society, due to the continuous advancement of transportation technology, there is an ongoing trend where scientists and tourists visit remote and untouched areas like the North Pole. While this trend has its drawbacks, I believe its merits are more evident.\nOn one hand, some argue that the presence of tourists and scientists in these isolated places can pose threats to both the explorers and the local environment. Firstly, tourists who are not accustomed to remote areas may face various serious challenges, including extreme weather conditions and encounters with wild animals. They could also suffer injuries like bone fractures, head trauma, or even fatal accidents in the worst-case scenarios. Additionally, the local environment may be directly affected by scientific activities. For instance, certain research projects, such as drilling, can disrupt the delicate balance of the local ecosystem. Consequently, these destinations not only lose their natural beauty but also risk overexploitation of their resources.\nOn the other hand, I believe there are significant benefits to this trend. Firstly, the advancements in transportation technology enable scientists to conduct valuable research in these pristine lands, contributing to global scientific progress. Specifically, these areas, such as the North Pole, harbor a wealth of fossils and rare microorganisms not found elsewhere. Therefore, scientists can utilize these unique flora and fauna systems to conduct research and make valuable discoveries. Secondly, visiting remote places like the North Pole provides a profound and educational experience. Visitors have the opportunity to observe wild animals in their natural habitats and experience extreme weather conditions firsthand. This exposure not only makes tourists aware of the dangers of climate change but also fosters a greater public commitment to environmental protection.\n"

      "paragraph": "Opinions are divided on whether schools should tailor their teaching methods to students' academic abilities or if it's better to have students with varying abilities study together. This essay will explore the rationale behind both perspectives, but I firmly support the latter.\nThose who advocate for tailoring teaching to students' academic abilities have several arguments. They may argue that teachers can more easily impart knowledge to students who quickly grasp lessons. For instance, in a math class where all students have a high IQ and strong logical skills, teachers can save time during instruction and employ the most effective teaching methods. Another possible argument is that students can enhance their strengths and abilities in their favorite subjects. To illustrate, when they study their preferred subjects, they can generate numerous new and creative ideas, leading to increased confidence and positive societal development.\nHowever, I still believe that there are several benefits to having students with diverse abilities study together. Foremost among these is the opportunity for collaborative development. In mixed-ability classes, students can learn from one another; those proficient in mathematics can assist those excelling in literature, and vice versa. Consequently, everyone can enhance their learning experience and overall development. Another reason is that through simple interactions, students can forge friendships in various fields, offering support not only in academics but also in acquiring a multitude of other skills.\nIn conclusion, it is understandable why some argue in favor of schools focusing on teaching according to students' abilities and interests.

In my view, governments have a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of life for city dwellers.\nOne primary issue for individuals contemplating a move to a large city is the considerably higher cost of living compared to small towns or villages. City residents face elevated expenses for housing, transportation, and even groceries. Additionally, urban areas frequently grapple with social issues like high crime rates and poverty, which are more prevalent than in rural settings. Furthermore, cities often contend with poor air quality due to traffic-related pollution, coupled with overcrowded streets and public transportation systems, leading to an unhealthy and stressful city life.\nNonetheless, there are practical measures that governments can adopt to address these concerns. Firstly, they could allocate funds to construct affordable or social housing, thus reducing living costs for the general populace. Secondly, policymakers have the authority to restrict private vehicles in city centers and encourage the use of cleaner public transportation, thereby mitigating both air pollution and traffic congestion. As an example, London has successfully alleviated traffic issues by implementing a congestion charge for drivers. A third viable approach would involve fostering the development of provincial towns and rural regions by relocating industries and job opportunities, thereby alleviating the strain on major cities.\nIn conclusion, governments possess the capacity to implement various strategies aimed at enhancing the quality of life in cities. By taking such steps, they can contribute significantly to creating more livable and prosperous urban environments for all residents.\n"

From my perspective, I would argue that this can be highly advantageous but also comes with some potential disadvantages.\nOn the one hand, family-owned businesses offer numerous benefits. Firstly, a noticeable advantage of such companies is their ability to reduce operational costs. Family members can take on multiple roles within the company or share responsibilities, thus minimizing the need to terminate employees and, consequently, reducing labor expenses. Moreover, another advantage of family-run businesses is the security they provide. Since all personnel are family members who trust each other, the company can maintain the confidentiality of its vital information.\nOn the other hand, working in a family company can lead to two problems. Firstly, disputes among family members related to profit sharing and funds might arise. These family-related conflicts can result in poor decision-making, which can, in turn, affect the work processes and the achievement of organizational goals. Another drawback of this type of business is a potential lack of seriousness. Collaborating with family members may create a sense of comfort, but it can also lead individuals to become lazy and irresponsible in their tasks. For instance, if family members believe they are immune to demotion and dismissal, they might neglect their responsibilities, leading to missed deadlines and reduced overall productivity.\nIn conclusion, despite the practical benefits of family-run enterprises in terms of security and cost reduction, we should not overlook the drawbacks, such as family disputes and the potential lack of professionalism.\n"

One proposed solution is to encourage people to enter the workforce at an earlier age. This essay will assess whether this alternative represents a positive or negative development by examining its advantages and drawbacks.\nThere are several merits to the idea of individuals commencing their careers at a younger age.\nTo begin with, an early start in one's career can lead to improved financial stability during retirement. With a longer working lifespan, individuals can amass more savings and pension contributions, ensuring a more comfortable retirement. This not only benefits individuals but also eases the burden on social welfare systems, as fewer people would depend solely on public pensions.\nMoreover, beginning work early facilitates continuous skill enhancement. Younger individuals can engage in training, education, and skill acquisition, making them more adaptable and competitive in the job market. This perpetual learning enhances employability, reduces the risk of unemployment, and ultimately results in more fulfilling careers.\nHowever, there are also noteworthy negative consequences associated with promoting early entry into the workforce.\nOne significant concern is the potential impact on education. Encouraging early career entry may dissuade young people from pursuing higher education or advanced degrees. Rushing into work may limit their opportunities for personal and intellectual growth, hindering their long-term career prospects and overall societal development.\nAdditionally, an extended period of work can lead to burnout and health issues, particularly when individuals are engaged in physically or mentally demanding jobs. The strain of continuous work until an older age could result in a decline in overall well-being, affecting not only individuals but also society in terms of healthcare costs and reduced productivity.\nIn conclusion, the alternative of encouraging people to start their careers at a younger age in response to increasing life expectancy presents both advantages and disadvantages. While it can enhance financial security, skill development, and reduce the burden on social welfare systems, it also risks impeding education, contributing to burnout, and affecting overall well-being.

I aim to provide an impartial assessment of both perspectives before sharing my own viewpoint.\nTo commence, proponents of investing in faster public transportation assert that such initiatives yield specific advantages. Firstly, the implementation of swifter transportation options can significantly reduce commuting time for citizens, particularly for daily commuters. This, in turn, would afford individuals more leisure time, ultimately boosting their productivity at work. Secondly, by embracing diverse modes of conveyance, people can avoid overcrowded and uncomfortable buses. Consequently, there would be no need to rush to work or wake up excessively early to secure a bus seat. As a result, individuals would have additional time to prepare for their day or relish a leisurely breakfast with their families.\nHowever, an array of compelling arguments supports the opposing viewpoint. Firstly, it is argued that governments should prioritize investment in eco-friendly transportation systems. Specifically, the excessive use of personal vehicles depletes valuable natural resources like oil and fuel. Therefore, it becomes imperative to promote eco-friendly modes of transport to reduce traffic congestion and curb air pollution, which is beneficial for the environment. Moreover, in an era marked by inflation, governments must take steps to lower transportation costs, ensuring that public transportation remains accessible to all and preventing price hikes on essential goods and services that depend on transportation.

By boycotting products from companies that do not prioritize environmental responsibility, consumers can exert pressure, prompting these companies to reconsider their packaging choices. Consequently, companies will be compelled to adopt more environmentally friendly practices and reduce their packaging. It is crucial for consumers to unite in this effort to effect meaningful change.\nIn conclusion, both companies and individuals must take responsibility for the amount of packaging used for products. The government also plays a vital role in addressing this issue by establishing and enforcing regulations governing plastic packaging. Furthermore, educating individuals about the environmental consequences of packaging waste is crucial in fostering awareness and promoting responsible consumption.\n"

      "question": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of relocating for personal career development?",
      "paragraph": "As we step into the new millennium, a prevailing trend that captures widespread attention is personal career development. It is undeniable that in many countries, individuals seeking employment often confront the need to relocate, leaving their friends and families behind. While this decision does come with some drawbacks, its advantages may outweigh the disadvantages.\nOn one hand, there are certain minor disadvantages associated with relocating to different places. One potential issue is the feeling of isolation that people may experience when living far away from their parents and friends. This can be attributed to the fact that in pursuit of gainful employment, individuals often have to distance themselves from their primary sources of support in their daily lives. This phenomenon can be observed among international students who choose to study abroad in foreign countries, leading to feelings of isolation and even stress due to the challenges of adapting to a new culture. Consequently, the state of one's mental well-being becomes a crucial aspect of personal development, which can help them overcome negative emotions. Without a stable psychological state, individuals may perceive their lives as unbalanced.\nNonetheless, establishing a career in a different location can yield significant advantages that outweigh these negative impacts. Perhaps the most conspicuous benefit is the exposure to diverse knowledge and experiences that urban centers and distant workplaces can offer. This exposure plays a pivotal role in enabling individuals to recognize potential opportunities when they become part of an organization. It is for this reason that an increasing number of young adults are willing to accept the idea of being separated from their close acquaintances. Additionally, it is worth noting that enhanced social skills and improved language proficiency can be cultivated through regular interactions with others. This development translates into increased self-confidence and independence when connecting with people, ultimately contributing to their ability to achieve success in their lives.\nIn conclusion, despite the potential downsides associated with physical separation from loved ones, these drawbacks are overshadowed by the significant positive effects that such a move can bring about.\n"

      "paragraph": "Freshwater has always been a limited resource in certain arid regions throughout history. However, in the contemporary era, a range of factors has escalated the scarcity of freshwater, making it a global concern. This essay will elucidate some contributing factors to this issue and propose measures that national authorities and individuals can adopt to address the increasing demand for clean, salt-free water.\nFirst and foremost, the burgeoning global population stands as the most significant factor driving the surge in the need for potable water. Additionally, the escalating pollution of natural freshwater reservoirs due to urbanization and industrialization has further exacerbated this demand. Furthermore, the contemporary trend of using freshwater for leisure activities, such as recreational swimming, has also accelerated the global demand for water.\nTo counteract this trend, governments can play a pivotal role by initiating public education campaigns aimed at promoting responsible water usage. Stringent national regulations must be put in place to prevent the pollution of natural freshwater reserves. Moreover, governments should invest in infrastructure for desalinating seawater, thereby increasing the availability of freshwater resources to meet the growing demand.\nSimilarly, individuals can contribute significantly to this noble cause by conserving water and reducing their daily household water consumption. It is essential for individuals to refrain from activities that pollute natural freshwater sources.\nIn conclusion, while the scarcity of freshwater is becoming an increasingly severe global issue, there are various means and methods available to both governments and individuals to prevent the situation from worsening. By addressing the root causes of increased demand and implementing responsible water management practices, we can work collectively to ensure that freshwater remains accessible for generations to come.\n"

      "paragraph": "A significant number of today's teenagers have chosen online socializing over face-to-face interactions. This trend can be attributed primarily to the pervasive integration of technology into our daily lives. To prevent potential long-term consequences, it is essential to consider some solutions.\nFirst and foremost, humans are naturally social beings, which has historically aided our collective survival. However, as time has passed, technological advancements have brought about significant changes in various aspects of human existence. Technology has evolved to offer convenience, gradually becoming an integral part of our lives and influencing our behavior and interpersonal interactions. Consequently, the preference for online socializing has emerged due to its quick and easily accessible nature. Prolonged engagement in online socializing may diminish physical interactions among individuals, potentially leading to issues in the foreseeable future.\nTo address this challenge, it is crucial to strike a balance between technological integration and in-person socialization. Local authorities should receive increased funding to create public spaces, such as parks, where teenagers can gather and engage in physical social interactions with their friends. Moreover, education can play a vital role by promoting on-campus clubs and organizations that stimulate student interactions after school hours. Additionally, investments in concerts and festivals can serve as effective incentives for younger generations to venture out of their comfort zones and meet new people.\nIn conclusion, the preference for online socializing is primarily driven by its inherent convenience. To address this issue, it is important to support outdoor activities that encourage physical interactions within communities and academic environments. By striking a balance between technology and in-person interaction, we can ensure that teenagers continue to develop essential social skills while enjoying the benefits of modern technology.\n"

      "paragraph": "There is a widely held belief that reading books for enjoyment is more advantageous for nurturing imagination and acquiring language skills compared to watching TV. In my view, I believe that both reading and watching television play an equally significant role in enhancing intelligence and language abilities.\nOn one hand, books are invaluable in stimulating a child's imagination and overall development. When a child engages with a fairy tale that includes illustrations, they are compelled to think, imagine, and exercise their creativity to comprehend the concepts and logic presented. This, in turn, hones their cognitive skills. Furthermore, reading books contributes significantly to language skill enhancement. Devoting time to reading a book written in a language other than one's mother tongue can lead to the establishment of a strong linguistic foundation, involving vocabulary expansion and a deeper understanding of word meanings in various contexts. Additionally, reading books aloud to children serves as an effective method to enhance their communication skills. This occurs as children grasp spoken words from the books and incorporate them into their daily conversations.\nOn the other hand, watching television is regarded as an important activity in terms of nurturing one's imagination, primarily due to the diverse nature of television programming. To illustrate, when viewers tune in to a travel channel, they are exposed to a wealth of knowledge through captivating visuals of landscapes from around the world or the enticing flavors of different regional cuisines. Additionally, quiz shows broadcasted on television serve as an effective educational tool for both children and adults who enjoy challenges that require critical thinking. Furthermore, television plays a pivotal role in enhancing linguistic proficiency. Modern English programs not only facilitate vocabulary retention by associating words with vivid on-screen images but also maintain the viewer's attention through entertaining content.\nIn conclusion, while the advantages of reading for pleasure are undeniable, they should not be pitted against the role of television in fostering a person's imagination and language skills. Both activities can coexist and complement each other in the journey toward personal growth and development.\n"

I partly agree with this argument, as both actions can serve specific purposes.\nFirstly, I acknowledge that allocating funds to renovate old public buildings holds some merit. This is because the restoration of existing structures necessitates the expertise of specialized workers and architects, aiming not only to enhance their appearances but also to preserve their historical significance. Consequently, this can significantly boost local tourism and contribute to the overall economy. For instance, Hang Dau water-tower, which has been in existence since the 18th century, underwent renovations that not only increased its historical value but also drew in even more tourists than before. In summary, rejuvenating existing public buildings can yield numerous benefits.\nHowever, there are compelling reasons why I believe that creating new ones offers more advantages. The primary rationale is that we currently inhabit a fully digital world where technology permeates every aspect of life, including tourism. Consequently, organizations can incorporate modern technology into new constructions, enhancing the tourist experience. Nowadays, journeys are more immersive than ever thanks to technological equipment and devices. For example, technology has bridged the gap between the present and the past, allowing visitors to interact with objects that no longer exist. This is made possible through virtual reality and holograms, which are prevalent in modern locations. In general, erecting new public buildings offers advantages to both local and foreign visitors.\nIn conclusion, while I recognize the benefits of renovating old public buildings for society, I believe that new constructions provide a more satisfying experience for tourists, which old ones are unable to deliver.\n"

      "paragraph": "Introduction: The topic of children playing video games has become a significant concern in today's society. While this phenomenon can bring about certain benefits for children, it also has some drawbacks.\nBody 1: On one hand, there are several advantages associated with children playing video games. To begin with, playing video games can enhance children's cognitive skills and problem-solving abilities. This is because video games often require players to think critically, make quick decisions, and strategize to overcome in-game challenges. For example, puzzle-solving games or strategy-based games can improve a child's logical reasoning and analytical skills. As a result, children who play video games may demonstrate improved cognitive abilities, which can be beneficial for them. Additionally, video games can foster social connections and teamwork among children. This is mainly due to the fact that many video games offer multiplayer options, allowing children to play and communicate with friends or other players online. For instance, games that involve challenges, missions, or team-based objectives require players to work together, strategize, and coordinate their efforts. Therefore, by engaging in multiplayer video games, children can develop important social skills, learn to work in teams, and build friendships with others who share similar interests.\nBody 2: On the other hand, this issue can have several negative influences on children. Firstly, excessive video game playing can lead to physical inactivity. Indeed, playing for several hours daily leaves little opportunity for physical exercise and outdoor activities that are important for health. Consequently, children may experience health issues like obesity and muscle weakness, and this sedentary lifestyle can have long-term consequences for their overall well-being. Secondly, excessive video game playing can negatively impact academic performance. This can be explained by the fact that video games can be highly engaging and time-consuming, leading children to neglect their homework, assignments, and studying. For example, due to their gaming habits, students spend the time and mental energy that should be devoted to academic pursuits on gaming, leading to a lack of focus and reduced productivity. Hence, this issue has a detrimental effect on their educational development and future opportunities.\nConclusion: In conclusion, this trend may offer advantages in terms of cognitive and communication skills.

While some argue that this trend brings about negative consequences, others perceive it as a positive development. This essay supports the idea that employing technology benefits both students and educators.\nUndoubtedly, the internet has granted learners access to an extensive range of information, surpassing what was available through traditional educational methods. This shift has transformed the way people acquire knowledge, allowing students to explore and study any subject at their convenience. The internet has also made it possible to access resources like online libraries, scholarly articles, and research papers, which were previously unavailable in traditional educational settings. Therefore, the effectiveness of technology in facilitating learning is undeniable, and it should be integrated into the educational curriculum.\nHowever, critics of technology's role in education argue that it diminishes human interaction, a crucial aspect of the learning process. Human interaction fosters essential skills such as communication, empathy, and debate. Nevertheless, it is feasible to maintain human interaction even within a technological environment. For example, platforms like Skype, Zoom, and other video conferencing tools enable students to engage with their peers and instructors, offering opportunities for the exchange of ideas and knowledge. Similarly, social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter facilitate discussions on various subjects, creating avenues for human interaction even in virtual settings.\nIn conclusion, the internet has transformed the learning landscape by granting learners access to vast amounts of information at their fingertips.

      "paragraph": "Many people believe that having fewer dominant languages would facilitate more efficient communication among individuals from diverse backgrounds and cultures. However, I hold the opinion that every language possesses intrinsic value in conveying unique cultural insights and the cognitive abilities of a country, a region, and an ethnicity.\nTo begin with, it can take thousands of years for a language to evolve into its current form. Consequently, each language represents a priceless and enduring heritage of its ethnic group. Although languages are intangible, they rank among a nation's highest priorities for preservation. Throughout history, numerous nations have wielded their languages as powerful tools to safeguard their freedom. For instance, Vietnam successfully preserved the Vietnamese language despite enduring nearly a millennium of Chinese invasion.\nDespite the argument that a reduction in the number of languages could save time in communication, multilingualism remains one of the most effective means of promoting and embracing cultural diversity. Indeed, many countries allocate substantial resources annually to initiatives aimed at revitalizing their ancient languages. The more we delve into our languages, the more we come to cherish our history and culture. Furthermore, understanding a language is often the first step in learning about other cultures.\nIn conclusion, while some may argue that fewer languages would enhance communication efficiency, I firmly believe that any language, regardless of the number of its speakers, plays a pivotal role in preserving the cultural and distinctive values of its ethnic group.\n"

While some people argue that this is a negative trend, I agree with those who believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\nOn the one hand, it is undeniable that advanced technologies can have certain negative effects on students. Firstly, modern technologies may contribute to children becoming addicted to them, diverting their attention from important responsibilities such as learning. For example, some schoolboys in Vietnam skip classes to play online games, which can be detrimental to their education. Secondly, prolonged periods spent sitting in front of screens and staring at them can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, increasing the risk of health issues such as obesity and eye-related problems. However, it is important to note that only a minority of children experience game addiction or suffer from these health issues. This suggests that technologies have become widely integrated into the lives of youngsters in various ways.\nThe drawbacks of technologies appear to be relatively minor. Therefore, I would argue that thanks to modern technologies, children have more opportunities to expand their knowledge and stay connected with their peers. One reason for this is the availability of various TV programs and games that not only offer entertainment but also impart knowledge and information. Discerning parents can choose channels like Discovery or educational games such as Math games, enabling their children to learn about wildlife or improve their math skills while having fun. Another reason is that innovative technologies such as social networking sites and messaging services have revolutionized communication, making it more convenient for children to stay in touch with their friends. Students who wish to discuss school lessons with their classmates can simply use apps like Skype to send instant messages or make video calls.\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that although there are still some issues associated with state-of-the-art technologies, they make children's leisure time more enjoyable and beneficial when used appropriately.\n"

To secure a stable job with a high income, they often have to distance themselves from their parents and friends, who provide constant support in their daily lives.

Some people believe that governments should focus their financial support on artists, musicians, and poets, while others view such allocation of funds as wasteful. In this essay, I will explore both sides of this issue and then share my personal perspective.\nThere is no doubt that government investment in various forms of art can yield numerous benefits. Firstly, this practice helps preserve cultural art by encouraging individuals to unleash their creativity. This, in turn, lays a strong foundation for more productive expressions of traditional art. For example, historical poems can be included in educational materials, preserving national heritage and inspiring younger generations to embrace and strengthen their country's culture. Additionally, financial support can help domestic art forms gain global recognition and expand their reach through collaborations with other countries, thus enhancing a nation's cultural identity.\nOn the other hand, I believe that there are other critical sectors that also warrant attention, such as education and healthcare, which have a direct impact on human well-being. By allocating a significant portion of the national budget to these fields, governments can offer residents access to a broader range of high-quality educational programs and essential healthcare services. This fulfills individuals' desires for lifelong learning and better overall welfare, ultimately contributing to more vibrant and sustainable development. Moreover, some countries may face resource constraints, and if they invest heavily in traditional art forms, they may struggle to adequately fund all essential social aspects and ensure national security. This is primarily because governments must maintain a certain level of financial reserves to address potential bankruptcies and financial crises.\nIn conclusion, while supporting art forms can play a role in preserving and developing national culture, I still believe that several crucial elements deserve investment.

      "paragraph": "Some individuals have proposed the implementation of a curfew for teenagers in certain areas of the United States to address issues like juvenile delinquency. However, this essay will argue against this idea, mainly because it is intrinsically discriminatory.\nThe primary and most significant reason why imposing a curfew on teenagers should be avoided is that it rests on the incorrect assumption that all teenagers are inclined towards troublemaking. While it is indeed accurate that some teenagers engage in minor criminal activities, it is unjust to penalize all adolescents for the actions of a few. It is fundamentally unjust to restrict young people from leaving their homes simply because a small fraction of them are involved in illegal activities. This constitutes a clear case of discrimination. Consider if all individuals in their thirties were barred from going outside because most burglaries were committed by individuals in that age group. It appears absurd, doesn't it?\nFurthermore, the potential impact on teenagers' psychological well-being is concerning. By compelling them to stay indoors after a specific time, society is essentially conveying the message that they are akin to criminals. This could have a profoundly detrimental effect on their mental health, as it instills negative associations in their subconscious minds. Teenagers require freedom as they transition into young adulthood, and they need societal trust to mature into responsible individuals. When they are treated as wrongdoers by others, they are likely to develop feelings of inferiority.\nIn conclusion, while a curfew may appear to be a rational response to juvenile delinquency issues, it is, in fact, more likely to harm the well-being of teenagers and should not be put into practice.\n"

This essay will propose some possible methods to chastise these children.\nThere are two chief reasons for this negative phenomenon from my perspective. First and foremost, it is evident that the financial burden and a multitude of work commitments have been leading to the negligence in enlightening about moral codes for their infants. This, in turn, renders inappropriate behaviors and the absence of moral cognition in the future. For example, youngsters who experienced an unsupervised childhood have to explore new things by themselves and therefore easily become vulnerable if undesirable actions are exposed to them. Additionally, the dysfunctional family is a precursor for the prevalence of juvenile delinquency in today's society. This is because the toddlers will subliminally imitate the adults' actions, consequently growing a troubled adolescence.\nAlongside many aforementioned reasons that affect the behavioral development of children, there are myriad ways to discipline their actions. To begin with, attending community projects is a reasonable disciplinary measure for juveniles, benefiting not only themselves but also society. For instance, helping the elderly teaches them to be grateful for the life they are living. In addition, rehabilitation might be appropriate for those who are in trouble with misdemeanors such as mugging or violence. In these programs, enrichment sessions educate them about the repercussions of their behaviors and values inherent in virtuous actions. If the severity of the crime was fearsome, imprisonment would be an adequate chastisement for them without any exception.\nIn conclusion, violent behaviors in adolescents are attributed to myriad reasons, but there are enormous ways to discipline them and expose them to the right path.\n"

Therefore, allocating a significant portion of the national budget to the construction of new houses would have more advantages. While I understand why many people argue that the government should maintain old houses, I am more inclined to support spending state funds on building new ones, considering a variety of benefits.\nTo begin with, there are numerous benefits associated with preserving historic buildings. One of the most notable advantages is that the continuous conservation of these age-old structures can greatly boost local tourism due to their historical and cultural significance. Take Hoi An as a prime example, which maintains a consistent architectural style and has become a popular tourist destination as a result. If any of these buildings were to be transformed into modern structures, it would disrupt the overall architectural harmony of the area, diminishing the antique ambiance of Hoi An. Consequently, the town would lose its appeal to foreign visitors, leading to significant revenue losses for local businesses. Therefore, it is imperative for the government to preserve these historic buildings.\nHowever, I do believe that it would be more advantageous to allocate national funding toward the construction of new buildings. Firstly, houses built in contemporary styles not only contribute to a sense of dynamism and vitality but also allow for greater functionality. Specifically, modern houses tend to emphasize flexible geometric forms and multifunctional spaces, enabling a wide range of activities to take place simultaneously within the same area. Furthermore, modern constructions often feature more robust foundations and durable materials, enhancing structural integrity. This, in turn, allows new homes to withstand natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and tornadoes.\nIn conclusion, while preserving ancient buildings can be beneficial in certain cases, I am more convinced that it would be in the best interest of the state to invest their resources in constructing new houses.\n"

While some argue that food aid plays a crucial role in alleviating hunger, I personally believe that education is the key.\nTo begin with, there are valid arguments on both sides of the issue. Those who advocate for food aid argue that it provides immediate relief, especially in emergency situations. For instance, in Vietnam, areas affected by natural disasters often face long-term food shortages. Many businesses step in to donate food, which can help reduce starvation and malnutrition rates. Additionally, providing food aid ensures that people have the energy and resources to concentrate on their studies and work, ultimately contributing to hunger reduction.\nDespite these compelling reasons, I hold the view that education can effectively address food scarcity. Firstly, a well-rounded education offers a long-term solution to hunger. It empowers individuals to create and implement solutions that tackle the root causes of hunger, such as poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and political instability. Moreover, education equips people with the knowledge and skills needed to develop sustainable food production strategies. When individuals gain knowledge about agriculture, nutrition, or how to design protective devices for crops, they become better equipped to secure their own food supply.\nIn conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides of the issue, I firmly believe that education holds the potential to solve the problem of global hunger.\n"

      "question": "Should young adults work or travel after high school?",
      "paragraph": "Many people argue that in certain countries, it is beneficial for young adults to either work or travel for a year after completing high school before embarking on their university studies. While there are advantages to this practice, such as providing a break after the rigors of high school and gaining valuable life experiences while enhancing communication skills, there are also notable disadvantages. In my view, the drawbacks outweigh the benefits, as acquiring work experience and the ability to financially support their education are of paramount importance.\nOn the positive side, taking a year to travel can be beneficial to some extent. Firstly, young people often require a respite after the demanding high school period. This can be attributed to the fact that they have dedicated a year to intense learning and completing homework in preparation for final exams. Consequently, they need a break to refresh their minds and rejuvenate their spirits. Additionally, traveling for a year can significantly enhance their communication skills. For example, individuals who initially struggled to interact with strangers often find that after just a few months of travel, they can engage in fluent conversations with unfamiliar people. Traveling can open up new perspectives and life experiences for young adults.\nHowever, on the flip side, there are several compelling reasons why I believe that encouraging young adults to work is the superior choice. Firstly, when students enter the workforce early, they have the opportunity to acclimate themselves to a professional environment and gain valuable experience by interacting with colleagues in their chosen field. This practical experience can be instrumental in their future careers.\nMoreover, encouraging young people to work allows them to actively contribute to their tuition fees and living expenses, reducing the financial burden on their families. This financial independence fosters responsibility and encourages students to manage their expenses wisely.\nIn conclusion, while there are certain advantages to taking a year off for relaxation and communication improvement, the disadvantages in terms of missed work experience and financial independence are more substantial. It is essential to recognize that after completing university studies, the primary goal for most young adults is to secure employment. Therefore, encouraging them to enter the workforce early is a prudent choice that better prepares them for the challenges of the future.\n"

      "paragraph": "It is indeed true that the amount of quality time families spend together is decreasing in many parts of the world. This decline can be attributed to various factors, and in this essay, I will demonstrate that it will have significant consequences for both families and society.\nThere are two primary reasons why people are spending less time with their families compared to the past. Firstly, demanding work schedules are robbing individuals of the time they used to dedicate to their families. In today's society, most people are engrossed in their jobs and struggle to find enough time to connect with their spouse or children. Another prominent factor leading to reduced family time is the excessive use of technology. With the widespread availability of digital devices like smartphones and tablets, a growing number of people, particularly younger generations, are becoming overly dependent on these technologies, which isolates them from their families. For instance, many teenagers today prefer texting their friends on social media rather than engaging in conversations with their parents.\nI would argue that this trend of reduced family time will have severe consequences not only for individual families but also for society at large. Concerning the former, the lack of family time is creating a growing distance between family members, potentially resulting in misunderstandings and, in the worst-case scenario, even leading to divorces. As for the latter, the deterioration of family relationships could contribute to a range of social problems. For instance, when parents allocate more time to their jobs and less time to their children, they inadvertently expose their children to negative influences from peers or excessive media consumption. This, in turn, can contribute to an increase in violence and crime.\nIn conclusion, the primary culprits for the decreasing amount of family time are demanding work schedules and the excessive use of technological gadgets. I firmly believe that this trend has numerous adverse effects on both families and society as a whole.\n"

      "paragraph": "In the context of a vibrant cultural exchange, people tend to explore, experience, and appreciate various cultures. There is an opinion that individuals can gain profound insights into culture through books, documents, films, and the Internet, rather than through traveling. I strongly disagree with this viewpoint, and in this essay, I will present my perspective on the issue.\nFirstly, traveling offers numerous unique benefits that cannot be fully gleaned from sources such as books, news, or films. When individuals embark on journeys, they have the opportunity to immerse themselves in culture in a genuine, intuitive, and vivid manner. Many remarkable aspects of a culture can only be truly understood through personal experience, as they depend entirely on individual perspectives, lifestyles, and preferences. For instance, Chinese cuisine may not align with American tastes, but it may be a perfect match for Vietnamese palates. Furthermore, the growth of the tourism industry serves as compelling evidence of the allure of travel.\nAnother crucial consideration is the objectivity of books, films, and online news. Each piece of literature or media is influenced by the author's perspective and intentions. Some news stories about specific places may be published with the aim of boosting local tourism, even if the actual conditions do not match the descriptions provided. As another example, television shows that promote tourism often meticulously plan their content, showcasing only the positive aspects of a destination while concealing its weaknesses.\nTaking everything into account, I firmly support the idea of experiencing culture firsthand through travel. Through this means, people can gain the most authentic understanding of different cultures and connect with their own emotions.\n"

In my perspective, the latter option holds more merit.\nTo begin with, proponents of single-gender schools argue that they can help reduce the distractions associated with early relationships. Without the concerns of such distractions, students can focus more diligently on their studies, potentially achieving higher academic results than those in mixed-gender schools. Additionally, supporters of this viewpoint assert that males and females have distinct learning requirements. Separate schools can tailor their teaching methods, lifestyle arrangements, subject choices, and educational programs to cater to the specific needs of each gender, potentially enhancing the learning experience. This perspective suggests that single-gender classes are preferable.\nOn the contrary, I believe that students benefit more from attending mixed-gender schools. Firstly, co-ed schools provide numerous opportunities for students to interact and engage with peers of the opposite sex through group activities. This interaction fosters the development of a wide range of skills, including teamwork and communication, which are essential for future employment prospects. Moreover, mixed-gender schools play a crucial role in educating students about coexistence and gender equality, facilitating a deeper understanding and respect for individuals of all genders. This exposure allows students to appreciate the similarities and differences among genders.\nIn conclusion, while some advocate for single-sex schools, I personally believe that students can derive greater benefits from studying in mixed-gender schools.\n"

Some students opt to enroll in additional classes beyond their main subjects to become well-rounded individuals. However, in my view, it's crucial for them to primarily focus on their major subjects to obtain a relevant qualification.\nOn one hand, many undergraduates, especially those in today's generation, aspire to receive a comprehensive education to reach their full potential. Universities typically provide a broader range of subjects covering various aspects of society compared to high school curricula. Consequently, some students enter university believing that taking more subjects will better prepare them for future careers. In today's competitive job market, having knowledge in a minor field or possessing a multidisciplinary skill set can enhance one's employability and adaptability.\nOn the other hand, students must carefully consider whether to allocate their time and energy to numerous subjects or concentrate on major-related courses. Freshmen may assume they have ample time to explore other topics, especially since the first-year program often includes more general subjects than major-specific ones. However, specialized fields of study demand dedicated focus to grasp their increasingly complex content. If university students divert their attention from their major by studying irrelevant subjects, they may not acquire in-depth knowledge necessary for obtaining a qualification, which can hinder their academic progress. In some cases, attempting to learn too many things concurrently can lead to delayed graduation due to inefficient time management, resulting in lower academic performance or even exam failure.\nIn conclusion, while continuous learning is undeniably valuable, I believe that students should prioritize their major subjects. Their ultimate goal, obtaining a qualification, hinges on this focus, ensuring they are well-prepared for their chosen career path.\"\n"

      "paragraph": "In recent times, numerous companies and factories have increasingly turned to automation to carry out tasks that were previously performed by human labor. This shift has both positive and negative consequences, and this essay will examine whether the benefits of this trend outweigh the drawbacks.\nFirstly, machines excel at performing dangerous tasks that are perilous for humans. This significantly reduces the rate of workplace accidents and fatalities. Consequently, employees can lead safer lives without the constant fear of injury or death. Moreover, the adoption of sophisticated machinery can substantially augment a company's or factory's profitability. For instance, advanced machines enable the safe and efficient production of antimatter, a substance valued at an astonishing $100 million per billionth of a gram.\nSecondly, machines enhance work efficiency through their remarkable speed and formidable power. Tasks such as lifting, transporting, and packaging goods can be physically exhausting for human workers. Additionally, employees often find themselves repetitively carrying out the same actions over extended periods, depending on the complexity of the product. In contrast, machines can operate at high speeds without pause, although their functionality may still be influenced by their age.\nHowever, it's important to acknowledge that machines are not without their challenges. If machines outperform human workers, there is a risk of employees losing their jobs and the salaries that sustain their livelihoods. In cases where workers struggle to meet their living expenses, they may resort to criminal activities to secure quick income, thereby negatively impacting societal progress and development.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that the positive effects of automation outweigh the negative consequences.

While I agree with this notion, it's crucial to acknowledge potential negative repercussions.\nIt is undeniably true that children should face consequences when they behave inappropriately. Firstly, this approach can contribute positively to their character development. Punishments serve as a means to raise their awareness about what actions are unacceptable. Additionally, it can deter them from entertaining harmful thoughts. Another noteworthy aspect is the role modeling provided by parents. Children often mimic their parents' behaviors, with youngsters as young as 4 or 5 imitating their parents' speech and actions. This phenomenon is encapsulated in the saying \"like father, like son,\" highlighting how children become small replicas of their parents.\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that certain forms of punishment may have adverse effects on children. For instance, in some Asian cultures, parents resort to physical punishment, such as spanking, as a disciplinary measure. Such harsh punishments can potentially lead to mental health issues in children, ultimately contributing to the development of negative personalities. Furthermore, a hostile upbringing environment can lead to the emergence of criminal tendencies.\nIn conclusion, the use of punishment stems from a place of care and concern and can be a catalyst for a child's betterment. Nonetheless, it is crucial to exercise caution and apply limits when administering punishments, as inappropriate or violent disciplinary actions can have detrimental effects on children.

In this essay, I will explore both perspectives and share my own opinion.\nFor some individuals, history holds great meaning, as it allows students to draw lessons from the mistakes of their predecessors. It offers insights into how a nation has evolved and the challenges it has faced, including the hardships of wars. This knowledge can instill a sense of pride in one's civilization and appreciation for the achievements of previous generations. However, history can also be perceived as tedious, primarily due to the way it is often taught in schools. Many students are required to memorize facts and dates, focusing solely on scoring high marks rather than gaining a deeper understanding of the subject.\nOn the other hand, the majority of students and their parents prioritize subjects like science and technology. They believe that these subjects offer practical benefits, including the potential for higher-paying jobs and the ability to stay updated with societal advancements, particularly in the age of the internet. Nevertheless, it is important to note that success in these subjects is not guaranteed, as many individuals may choose to study them without acquiring the necessary knowledge, resulting in wasted time and money. Furthermore, mastering subjects like science and technology can be challenging for those who struggle with logical thinking and lack a strong mindset.\nIn my view, history is indeed a fascinating subject, but its appeal may be limited to those who have a genuine interest in it. Subjects such as science and technology, on the other hand, are more practical and relevant to modern life and careers. The knowledge acquired in these fields can be directly applied in various real-world scenarios and professions. However, it is essential for students to approach these subjects with dedication and a genuine desire to learn, as success in any field requires effort and commitment.\nIn conclusion, the importance of school subjects varies from person to person.

In my view, the salary distinction between a worker and a manager is influenced by several key factors, which I will discuss in this essay.\nOn one hand, it is justifiable for senior managers to receive a higher salary than their colleagues. This is because their remuneration reflects their experience and dedication to the company. The greater the responsibility and experience, the more money they should earn. For example, when comparing a senior manager to a new employee, it is evident that the former possesses a wealth of knowledge and experience. Additionally, a company's budget is carefully allocated among all employees, including managers. Managers who contribute significantly to the company's profitability should be incentivized with additional compensation. Therefore, it is imperative that they put forth concerted efforts to generate more projects and attract more customers.\nHowever, it is essential to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of a significant income gap between managers and employees. The workplace can sometimes foster discrimination based on position. For instance, when new trainees aspire to climb the corporate ladder, they may find themselves burdened with extra tasks such as fetching coffee or completing assignments for senior managers. This can lead them to run errands in an attempt to avoid displeasing their superiors. Consequently, trainees often burn the midnight oil, striving to meet deadlines without receiving any recognition or praise from their bosses. Therefore, companies should strive to create an equitable work environment in which employees receive appropriate salaries based on their efforts and dedication.\nIn conclusion, while there are undeniable advantages to providing senior managers with higher compensation, it is essential to consider the impact on other workers.

In my view, I hold a neutral position in this discourse since both types of structures require financial investment for their construction and development.\nOn one hand, I acknowledge the merit of building more new public edifices. Notably, these structures exert a substantial influence on the local economy. They contribute to an increase in the income of local residents and attract a greater number of tourists. This is primarily because such constructions draw people to visit and partake in the services they offer. An apt example is the strategy adopted by numerous countries to bolster their economies by constructing new venues that allure tourists. Furthermore, new buildings are often erected as symbolic representations of countries or cities. Consequently, these structures become a source of community pride, enhancing the visibility and recognition of the respective country or city. A case in point is the multitude of iconic buildings in the United States that instantly symbolize the nation whenever it is mentioned. In conclusion, the construction of new edifices ranks among the paramount factors contributing to a nation's development.\nOn the other hand, there exist compelling reasons why I advocate for the government's engagement in renovating existing buildings. Foremost among these reasons is the role these structures play in preserving the cultural heritage of nations. As a result, countries can maintain their distinct charm and individuality, stemming from the unique architectural features inherent in these buildings. For instance, certain historical houses in Ha Noi are slated for restoration by the government to preserve their ancient cultural characteristics. Another rationale for my support of renovation is the potential for cost savings it offers to the government. Consequently, it aids in maintaining the economic stability of the country, as financial resources are not excessively squandered.

These corporations raise funds and generate revenue that can be allocated to critical areas, including education and healthcare. Additionally, by accumulating substantial financial resources, businesses have the opportunity to expand their operations, invest in technological advancements, and create new job opportunities by implementing training programs for interns.\nOn the flip side, enterprises bear a significant responsibility for social activities in our modern society. Firstly, they must minimize their impact on natural habitats. Corporations should exercise control over the disposal of industrial waste and factory emissions to prevent pollution of rivers and lakes. These actions play a vital role in averting global warming, excessive temperatures, and the spread of diseases. Furthermore, enterprises often engage in charitable work and organize volunteer campaigns. For instance, prominent corporations such as Unilever and Vinamilk have stepped up their philanthropic efforts, including making charitable donations and funding scholarships for students in underprivileged areas.\nIn conclusion, despite the undeniable advantages of generating substantial profits for companies, I am convinced that voluntary activities continue to play a pivotal role in promoting their products and safeguarding the environment.\n"

Firstly, engaging in activities beyond their daily responsibilities can be crucial for maintaining good mental health. To be more precise, the burden of various daily tasks such as homework can become overwhelming and lead to feelings of irritation. Therefore, engaging in activities outside of their academic duties can assist in relieving stress and promoting a sense of calmness for future tasks. Additionally, entertainment activities outside the home can be highly beneficial for personal growth, particularly among teenagers.

To illustrate this point, families are enduring support systems that have a deep understanding of an individual's strengths and limitations. Consequently, family members can provide valuable insights to help individuals recognize these factors, overcome obstacles, and enhance their abilities. Furthermore, spending time with family members allows individuals to gain a better understanding of their roots.

Engaging in these pursuits entails facing dangers that can have severe and lasting impacts. A striking example is the renowned boxer Mike Tyson, whose sustained blows to the head during matches have resulted in a brain disorder. This serves as a poignant reminder of the potential long-term consequences endured by athletes involved in dangerous sports. It is crucial to acknowledge the profound risks and prioritize the well-being and safety of individuals. Apart from that, limited awareness and impulsive decision-making among young enthusiasts present significant challenges. Many individuals are attracted to risky sports primarily for the thrill and adrenaline rush they provide, often without fully comprehending the potential dangers involved. Their willingness to put their lives on the line for momentary excitement demonstrates a lack of awareness regarding the potential loss of life in the event of accidents. These impulsive decisions can have dire consequences, emphasizing the necessity for protective measures to ensure the safety of participants.

Firstly, a robust economy generates ample job opportunities, resulting in high employment rates. Consequently, people secure well-paying jobs, enhancing their quality of life. For instance, individuals earning substantial salaries can afford superior healthcare and education for their children, thereby contributing to societal improvement and development.

      "question": "Should businesses focus on profits or social responsibility?",
      "paragraph": "In this modern era, with the current widespread growth of the economy, many businesses are being established. Consequently, a prevailing belief asserts that businesses have not only a profit motive but also societal responsibilities. I wholeheartedly agree with this perspective, and I will elucidate my reasons below.\nFirst and foremost, it is crucial for businesses to focus on generating profits. The primary objective of every company is to be financially sustainable. Profits are essential to cover various expenditures, including operational costs, building expenses, utilities, and most importantly, employee salaries. If these firms fail to meet their financial obligations, they may face bankruptcy and struggle to compete in today's competitive landscape. Consequently, the unemployment rate could surge, leading to a decline in people's overall quality of life.\nSimilarly, companies should actively contribute positively to society. To begin with, business owners and managers must prioritize the well-being of their employees by ensuring they receive a fair and sustainable wage, thus enhancing their quality of life. Furthermore, businesses should also address environmental concerns and fulfill their tax obligations by allocating a portion of their profits to national budgets, instead of attempting to minimize their tax liabilities through accounting strategies. Additionally, enterprises should consider supporting local charitable organizations, environmental initiatives, or educational projects. Such philanthropic actions, including providing scholarships, making charitable donations, and engaging in volunteer work, can enhance their public image. Furthermore, corporate leaders should be aware of the importance of investing in waste disposal equipment to protect the environment and safeguard people's well-being.\nIn conclusion, beyond their profit-making endeavors, companies should embrace their responsibility towards society, striving to make it better and more developed.\n"

      "question": "The pros and cons of globalization",
      "paragraph": "In today's world, marked by humanity's relentless pursuit of economic growth, the relationships between countries have garnered significant public attention. Some argue that the increasing global trade and cultural exchange between nations represent a positive development, while others fear that these trends may erode national identities. In this essay, I will explore the rationale behind both perspectives before expressing my inclination toward the latter.\nOn the one hand, the positive effects of commerce and cultural interaction primarily stem from tourism. Thanks to advances in transportation and the current prominence of tourism, countries have an opportunity to enhance their image in the eyes of the world. Consequently, national specialties such as cuisine, clothing, and festivals can be preserved and shared with international friends. Furthermore, economic growth contributes to national prosperity, leading to a significant boost in government budgets. This, in turn, allows for substantial investments in infrastructure and public services, resulting in increased employment opportunities and a lower unemployment rate, ultimately improving people's quality of life.\nOn the other hand, this trend carries not only positive but also detrimental consequences. Firstly, borderless commerce highlights the importance of a common international language. As a result, the world has transformed into a global village where people from diverse regions communicate in the same language, leading to a reduction in linguistic diversity worldwide. Additionally, the mutual benefits derived from international trade often lead to the decline of minor dialects on a global scale. Moreover, the dominance of cultures from affluent countries accelerates the erosion of other nations' cultural uniqueness. For example, in a well-known city in Vietnam, we can clearly observe the proliferation of international cuisines. Similarly, Vietnamese youth increasingly prefer American and Korean music, movies, and TV shows over their traditional folk songs, dances, and dramas.\nIn conclusion, while the development of borderless commerce and cross-cultural interactions between nations brings undeniable advantages, I believe that the aforementioned drawbacks outweigh the benefits. Consequently, governments should implement rational measures to mitigate the negative effects of these trends.\n"

      "paragraph": "In this modern era, owing to the ever-expanding influence of technology, e-commerce has garnered considerable attention. Nevertheless, there are those who argue that it may have adverse effects on individuals and society. While e-commerce does indeed come with certain disadvantages, I am of the opinion that its benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.\nOn the downside, there are numerous disadvantages associated with e-commerce. To begin with, individuals often encounter unsatisfactory shopping experiences when making online purchases. Specifically, they are unable to physically touch and feel the products they intend to buy. Consequently, sellers may deliver subpar products, leaving customers feeling frustrated and disappointed. Moreover, there is a heightened risk of falling victim to cybercriminals. When people log into their accounts, their personal information becomes more vulnerable to potential leaks. Consequently, cybercrimes can easily target them, resulting in significant financial losses.\nOn the other hand, despite the aforementioned drawbacks, I believe that the advantages of e-commerce are more pronounced. Firstly, when people buy products on online shopping platforms, they tend to find items at more affordable prices. To elaborate, since sellers do not have to bear certain expenses such as rent, employee salaries, or utility bills, they can offer products at competitive price points. This means that even individuals with modest incomes can access a wide range of products in various colors, materials, and sizes at prices within their budget. Another notable benefit is the substantial time and effort savings for buyers. With an internet-connected device, people can make purchases that are conveniently delivered to their doorstep. A case in point is Shopee, a popular online shopping application in Southeast Asia, offering a diverse array of products at competitive prices, allowing customers to make hassle-free purchases. Consequently, consumers can save both time and travel expenses.\nTo conclude, thanks to technological advancements, online shopping has become increasingly popular in today's world. While this trend does have its potential downsides, I firmly believe that the long-term advantages it offers are far more significant.\n"

      "paragraph": "In the present era, wildlife conservation is a matter of concern in numerous nations. Some individuals contend that society allocates excessive attention to this issue, suggesting that resources could be better utilized elsewhere. While this viewpoint holds validity to some degree, I maintain that it is crucial to enhance public awareness and increase investments in wildlife preservation.\nOn one hand, it is argued that government expenditures on human welfare should take precedence over safeguarding wild animals and their habitats. It is evident that various areas demand greater attention than animal protection. To illustrate, governments recognize the importance of animal preservation; however, they should prioritize other critical areas such as food, housing, and education. Cuba serves as a pertinent example, as it continues to face economic sanctions from the USA, resulting in economic stagnation and adversely affecting the lives of its citizens. Consequently, it is not only the well-being of animals but also that of human beings that requires safeguarding.\nOn the other hand, I contend that dismissing the significant advantages of allocating resources to protect wild animals would be imprudent. First and foremost, humans and wild animals share a symbiotic relationship. To elucidate, pollinating insects significantly enhance crop productivity. Bees, for instance, could face extinction if toxic chemicals are extensively used by humans. Furthermore, failure to allocate adequate resources to protect wild animals can lead to the proliferation of fatal diseases. For instance, bats may lose their natural habitat due to deforestation, subsequently relocating to residential areas where they can coexist with humans and potentially transmit deadly diseases. Therefore, safeguarding wildlife resources is indispensable for both individuals and society as a whole.\nIn conclusion, in today's world, wildlife conservation is a subject of concern in many countries. While some argue that society places excessive emphasis on this issue to the detriment of other important areas, I believe it is essential to heighten public awareness and increase investments in wildlife preservation. Hence, governments should carefully evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of this issue before arriving at the optimal solution.\n"

While this trend can be attributed to various factors, I believe that there are certain possible reasons and solutions that deserve consideration.\nOn one hand, there are numerous reasons that can explain why a significant number of ex-convicts exhibit a propensity to return to illegal activities after their release. First and foremost, individuals with prior criminal records often face significant social stigma following their initial punishment. Specifically, the public tends to hold negative views about ex-convicts, assuming that their inherent nature is flawed and unchangeable. Additionally, during their time in prison, inmates may come into contact with dangerous criminals and form relationships with them. Furthermore, upon their release, some former prisoners become involved in criminal organizations out of desperation. Consequently, ex-criminals struggle to secure legitimate employment to support themselves, leading them to engage in illegal activities, including minor offenses such as pickpocketing and shoplifting, which pose a threat to societal stability.\nOn the other hand, I believe that several effective solutions can be implemented to reduce the number of ex-prisoners who are inclined to reoffend upon their release. First and foremost, governments should offer vocational training programs for inmates, focusing on skills such as car maintenance, tailoring, and computer repair. These programs can capitalize on the knowledge and abilities that ex-convicts may already possess. Moreover, it is essential for the government to categorize prisoners into different wards based on the severity of their offenses. In doing so, prison administrators can organize additional educational sessions to raise awareness among inmates about the detrimental effects of criminal organizations. Consequently, many former prisoners can acquire the skills and means to earn a stable income, thus facilitating their reintegration into society.\nIn conclusion, there is an ongoing trend where many ex-criminals tend to reoffend after their release.

Nevertheless, some individuals raise concerns about whether communication technology may negatively impact interpersonal relationships. While this viewpoint has validity to some extent, I contend that it can also yield positive effects in fostering strong connections between individuals under certain circumstances.\nOn one hand, there is a belief that the proliferation of communication technology can have adverse consequences on interpersonal relationships. Such relationships can suffer from certain drawbacks. Foremost among these is the rapid advancement of electronic devices, which can potentially erode the quality of human connections. Particularly, this is exacerbated by people spending more time engrossed in their electronic gadgets than in face-to-face interactions with friends. Additionally, participating in online friendship applications can sometimes lead to unhealthy relationships, thereby contributing to the strain on interpersonal bonds. Consequently, the relentless pace of technological development has the potential to create distance and weaken relationships between people.\nOn the other hand, it is worth noting that the benefits of communication technology can be more prominent. Primarily, technological advancements enable individuals to connect with friends and family remotely using electronic devices. To illustrate further, people can easily initiate phone or video calls with loved ones. Moreover, they can expand their social circles and make new friends from across the globe through online friendship applications.

While this trend has its advantages, I firmly believe that its drawbacks outweigh the benefits.\nOn the positive side, the advantages of the tourism industry are quite apparent. Firstly, it can be viewed as a profitable sector for countries blessed with natural landscapes and impressive man-made structures. Specifically, such nations can generate substantial revenue from their tourism sector. Developed countries that excel in the tourism industry worldwide serve as prime examples of this. They utilize these earnings for various other purposes. Furthermore, the local population can benefit by creating more job opportunities, ultimately leading to an improvement in their living standards and contributing to the economic growth of the host countries.\nConversely, I hold the view that the tourism industry can have adverse effects on host countries in the long run. Firstly, the development of tourism has the potential to increase the incidence of social crimes in host countries, such as pickpocketing, robbery, and overpricing. To be more specific, the rising number of social crimes may pose a threat to social stability. This, in turn, can lead to an increase in real estate prices, making it difficult for local residents to secure permanent housing. Moreover, when an excessive number of visitors flock to tourist destinations, they often litter indiscriminately, leading to the endangerment of wild animals due to habitat destruction. Consequently, this affects the livelihoods of local residents, contributes to environmental degradation, and hinders economic growth.\nIn conclusion, the rapid growth of the tourism industry has had a significant impact on host countries. While there are clear advantages, it is my belief that the disadvantages far outweigh the benefits.

      "paragraph": "In the 21st century, due to people's unwavering pursuit of economic prosperity, the natural environment is deteriorating. This problem can be attributed to various factors. I believe that identifying these reasons and implementing potential solutions can address this issue.\nOn one hand, there are numerous factors contributing to the worsening environmental quality in recent years. Firstly, companies operating in industrial zones burn fossil fuels, such as coal, natural gas, and oil, which release excessive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This, in turn, leads to rising sea levels, causing the disappearance of coastal cities and an increase in natural disasters, including unpredictable ones. Global warming and climate change are direct outcomes of this phenomenon. Additionally, the higher living standards resulting from population growth and the influence of e-commerce have led to the mass production of inexpensive products with short life cycles, resulting in increased air pollution and the creation of landfills, as well as soil and water pollution.\nOn the other hand, I believe there are several effective solutions that can improve environmental quality. Firstly, governments can enact environmental laws aimed at enhancing the natural environment. Specifically, imposing heavy taxes on companies that rely on fossil fuels for profit could incentivize a shift towards renewable energy sources. Furthermore, allocating funds to develop energy-efficient machinery and renewable energy technologies, such as wind turbines and solar panels, would be a wise investment. The establishment of advanced waste disposal treatment systems is another critical step. Moreover, individuals can contribute by adopting eco-friendly lifestyles, such as using public transportation, recycling, segregating waste, and choosing green products over impulsive purchases. These actions can collectively lead to a significant improvement in environmental quality and reduce degradation.\nIn conclusion, the relentless pursuit of economic prosperity in the 21st century has led to the deterioration of the natural environment for various reasons.

      "paragraph": "The natural environment is currently being adversely impacted by the increasing production of consumer goods. This essay will explore the potential causes of this issue and propose solutions.\nThere are two primary reasons why the growing mass production of consumer goods is causing environmental harm. The first reason is the exploitation of natural resources by manufacturers in their production processes. For instance, trees in jungles are frequently cut down for paper and wood table manufacturing. Consequently, the depletion of trees in forests can contribute to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, ultimately leading to climate change. Secondly, the escalating production of consumer goods also results in greater environmental pollution. This is because as more consumer products are manufactured, more waste is generated by factories. Consequently, the accumulation of waste can become too extensive to be effectively managed, resulting in air pollution that negatively affects people's health.\nTo address this problem, two practical approaches can be implemented. On an individual level, everyone should consider reducing their consumption of consumer goods. People can maximize the use of their existing products instead of constantly purchasing new ones. On a governmental level, authorities can enact laws that compel manufacturers to limit the production of consumer goods to a specified quantity. This measure can help maintain a stable level of consumer goods production and effectively mitigate its environmental impact.\nIn conclusion, the expansion of consumer goods production can lead to environmental degradation due to the aforementioned reasons. Nevertheless, this issue can be mitigated through two viable solutions: individual efforts to reduce consumption and government regulations to control production quantities.\n"

While this perspective holds merit to some extent, I am of the opinion that it could have negative repercussions for both students and society.\nOn the one hand, there are numerous advantages to pursuing higher education. If a larger portion of the population attends college, society would experience overall development, and individuals would gain a broader knowledge base. This would subsequently enhance job prospects for many young people, foster their critical thinking abilities, and provide them with valuable life skills. Therefore, it is imperative that the government considers waiving tuition fees for students.\nOn the other hand, I believe it would be unwise to disregard the potential drawbacks of this policy in the long term. Firstly, a surplus of college graduates could outstrip the labor market's ability to accommodate them, resulting in increased unemployment rates. Secondly, diverting a substantial portion of the budget towards education could strain government finances, leading to budget deficits and, ultimately, necessitating tax hikes. Moreover, there are other critical areas such as healthcare, infrastructure, and defense that also require adequate funding. Therefore, we must carefully weigh these considerations.\nIn conclusion, while the idea of providing financial aid to all college students is appealing in many respects, we should also acknowledge the potential downsides it may entail.

Personally, I strongly disagree with this perspective.\nThere are several reasons why it would be inappropriate to reduce taxes for families who opt for private education. Firstly, determining the precise amount of tax reduction for these families would be a complex and challenging task, requiring additional administrative effort. Secondly, we all contribute a portion of our taxes to public services that we may not personally utilize. For instance, most people are fortunate enough never to require the assistance of the police or fire brigade throughout their lives, but they do not anticipate receiving a tax cut for this reason. Lastly, if affluent families were granted tax exemptions for enrolling their children in private schools, it could lead to a situation where less wealthy individuals end up paying higher taxes than the affluent ones.\nIn my view, it is crucial for all of us to willingly contribute our fair share of the funding that sustains public schools. A high-quality education system with equal opportunities for all young individuals benefits society as a whole. This results in a well-educated workforce and, consequently, a more productive and prosperous nation. Parents of children attending private schools may also appreciate the advantages of such a system in their own lives.

Consequently, there has been an observable trend where former criminals tend to return to illegal activities in order to make ends meet. While this trend can be attributed to certain individuals, I firmly believe that viable solutions can be devised to address it.\nOn one hand, there are numerous reasons that can account for the increasing prevalence of recidivism. Foremost among these is the fact that ex-convicts carry a stigma due to their prior criminal records. Specifically, the public often harbors doubts about their inherent character, which can lead to a reversion to unlawful behavior. Consequently, it becomes challenging for these former inmates to secure employment as a means of livelihood. Additionally, while incarcerated together, it is plausible that these individuals may discuss forming criminal networks after serving their sentences.

Subsequently, upon reintegration into society, they possess the capacity to collaborate on unlawful endeavors that yield greater financial gains compared to legitimate employment.\nOn the other hand, I am of the opinion that practical measures can be implemented to reduce the rate of recidivism. Firstly, it is imperative for the government to establish vocational training programs within correctional facilities where ex-prisoners can receive education and training for gainful employment. This entails not only engaging in agricultural activities during their sentence but also acquiring practical skills such as sewing and carpentry. Such initiatives provide former criminals with legitimate career opportunities instead of being drawn back into illegal activities.

At an individual level, students can acquire practical skills and gain valuable work experience without committing four years to a college education. This is particularly advantageous for economically disadvantaged students, given the exorbitant costs associated with university tuition, especially at top-tier institutions. Consequently, by enrolling in shorter-term courses, these students can swiftly enter the workforce, providing for their families and themselves. From a societal perspective, a balanced labor market with an equal number of skilled and unskilled workers is essential. Japan and Canada serve as prime examples, where a severe shortage of unskilled workers has led them to recruit employees from other developing nations to fill these gaps.\nOn the other hand, I firmly believe that the merits of a university education outweigh those of job training programs. Advocates of higher education argue that high school seniors who commit to pursuing further studies are more likely to acquire specialized knowledge, enabling them to excel in complex professions such as teaching, medicine, and engineering.

However, some individuals believe that this trend could have negative implications for both individuals and society. While this trend is not without its disadvantages, I firmly believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.\nOn one hand, there are numerous advantages to online shopping. Firstly, products on online shopping platforms are often priced more affordably. Specifically, when sellers operate on e-commerce sites, they are not burdened with expenses such as staff salaries, physical space, and utility bills. Consequently, they can offer competitive prices that are accessible to a wide range of consumers, including those with limited incomes. Secondly, online shopping is a convenient and efficient way to make purchases.

      "paragraph": "In contemporary society, there is an ongoing trend where many individuals tend to spend excessively on unnecessary items. This trend can be attributed to various factors, and I believe it may have several negative implications for individuals and society in the long term.\nOn one hand, there are numerous reasons to explain the growing popularity of consumerism. In recent years, the influence of advertisements has played a significant role in driving this behavior. Various methods are employed to promote products, including newspapers, billboards, and social media platforms. These advertising materials often feature vivid visuals and captivating sound effects, piquing consumers' curiosity. Consequently, people may find themselves succumbing to impulsive purchases, leading to financial debt. A prime example of this phenomenon is celebrity endorsements. When highly desirable figures endorse a particular product, its sales tend to surge, especially among young individuals who are naturally inclined to imitate. Additionally, the widespread adoption of mass production technology has made it easier for people to access affordable goods. Thanks to machinery and assembly lines, companies can manufacture a wide array of low-cost products. This accessibility extends even to individuals with limited incomes, further fueling consumerism. Unfortunately, this rapid turnover of products contributes to environmental pollution, including soil and water contamination.\nIn summary, the prevalence of excessive spending on unnecessary items can be attributed to factors like the persuasive power of advertisements and the availability of low-priced goods. However, this trend carries adverse consequences, such as financial debt and environmental degradation.\n"

      "paragraph": "The increase in the production of consumer goods is believed to have a detrimental impact on the natural environment. This essay will explore the reasons for this belief and suggest potential solutions to address this issue.\nIt is unquestionable that the greater the quantity of goods manufactured and available in the market, the more significant the harm inflicted on the natural environment. There are primarily two reasons for this. Firstly, the production of goods necessitates a substantial consumption of natural resources, leading businesses and manufacturers to exploit Mother Nature to fulfill their needs. Consequently, issues such as overexploitation and contamination become increasingly severe. For instance, the proliferation of factories results in the release of large quantities of toxic chemicals into the air and water, which severely pollute the environment. Secondly, as consumers purchase these goods, there is a substantial increase in the amount of waste generated within communities. Disposing of used items can pose challenges for individuals, as some items are difficult to dispose of properly. Take plastic products like bottles or bags, for example, which can take up to a century to completely decompose. Consequently, the surge in the production of goods in the market undoubtedly exerts negative impacts on the natural environment.\nTo address this problem, two potential solutions can be implemented by governments and citizens alike. Firstly, authorities could enact laws and regulations to limit environmental degradation by businesses and factories. These measures could include fines or penalties for entities that engage in overexploitation or release excessive waste into the environment. Furthermore, businesses and corporations can adopt policies that encourage consumers to responsibly dispose of used items. For example, some technology brands have implemented trade-in programs to reduce waste and provide cost savings for consumers. Consequently, individuals would have more opportunities to safeguard their living environments from the adverse effects of increased consumer goods.\nIn conclusion, the escalation in the production of consumer goods is undeniably linked to environmental damage. To mitigate this issue, governments and citizens can collaborate to implement stricter regulations and promote responsible consumer behavior, ultimately contributing to the preservation of our natural habitat.\n"

      "paragraph": "It is indisputable that one of the most intriguing topics of today revolves around advanced technology and its potential impact on interpersonal relationships. While this viewpoint holds some validity, I believe it could have adverse effects on both individuals and society.\nOn one hand, there are numerous advantages explaining why this trend has gained popularity in recent years. Firstly, there is a broader range of choices available on computers and other electronic devices connected to the internet. This satisfies people with different preferences for entertainment, such as watching movies, listening to music, or playing games on online platforms. Secondly, another noteworthy benefit is that individuals can easily connect with people around the world. It is evident that maintaining relationships used to be challenging with limited connections, but technological advancements have made it much easier with social media tools like Skype, WhatsApp, and FaceTime, which bring individuals closer.\nOn the other hand, it would be unwise to underestimate the significant drawbacks of virtual connections. To begin with, people may develop a passive lifestyle and potentially isolate themselves from society. This is because technology use can be highly addictive, leading individuals to spend hours in their rooms without any communication with the outside world if they are exposed too frequently. For instance, the recent surge in smartphone usage has come at the expense of genuine human interaction. This results in soft skills, such as verbal communication and empathy, being adversely affected. More importantly, excessive exposure to technology could lead to health issues, as spending hours using computers can cause significant harm to eyesight. In fact, some individuals are experiencing short-sightedness due to prolonged gaming sessions or extended browsing on Facebook.\nIn conclusion, while this technological development has brought about several necessary changes, it has also exposed society to some unpleasant consequences.\n"

While some individuals believe that the use of robots holds numerous advantages, others argue that it could potentially pose a long-term threat to human society. From my perspective, I lean towards the former viewpoint for several reasons, which I will explore below.\nOn one hand, there are compelling reasons to explain why the development of robotics engineering has had adverse effects on human life in recent years. To begin with, concerning manufacturing, the introduction of robots has led to the displacement of many human employees, resulting in an increase in unemployment rates. To illustrate, robots can effectively replace humans in performing repetitive and labor-intensive tasks such as driving, working in factories, and construction, with higher accuracy. Consequently, the living standards of these individuals decline, and they may be more inclined towards criminal activities. Take drivers, for instance. Furthermore, excessive reliance on labor-saving devices can encourage a sedentary lifestyle, which can lead to a decline in human health, making people more susceptible to lifestyle-related ailments like obesity and cardiovascular diseases.\nOn the other hand, I believe there are noteworthy benefits to the future of robotics technology for society. Firstly, in the field of medicine, bionic limbs can assist individuals with mobility disabilities in carrying out their daily activities. Additionally, nanotechnology can penetrate the human body without the need for complex surgeries. This is possible because, in this era of cutting-edge technology, artificial intelligence is often more efficient than humans and requires minimal maintenance.

While some may view this as a positive trend, I believe its impact should be evaluated in specific contexts, which I will discuss in this essay.\nTo start with, the increasing demand for workers in urban areas makes it a reasonable choice for rural residents to migrate to cities, provided that there is a well-thought-out government policy in place. In today's world, businesses require a substantial workforce to perform various tasks. Consequently, this presents a favorable opportunity for individuals from rural backgrounds to explore job prospects and advance in their careers. This phenomenon is in line with the broader trend observed in many cities, both nationally and globally.\nConversely, if this migration lacks proper planning and oversight from the authorities, it may result in what is known as spontaneous urbanization, which can spiral out of control. This can lead to significant consequences such as job shortages, housing problems, and public security concerns. Urbanization can indeed offer improved educational opportunities, but this hinges on the migrants possessing the necessary skills and qualifications. For instance, if a large influx of people moves to cities without carefully considering their options, it can lead to a shortage of housing and various other resources. Perhaps, if the authorities in rural areas were to enhance the quality of life for their citizens, individuals might be more inclined to stay in their hometowns rather than migrate to cities.\nIn conclusion, the movement of people from rural to urban areas is not inherently negative; however, it is crucial to strike a balance and implement effective government planning to ensure that the consequences of this shift are positive rather than detrimental.\n"

      "paragraph": "Nowadays, it is widely acknowledged that some celebrities gain their fame primarily through their glamorous appearance and wealth rather than their actual achievements, and this may set a questionable example for young people. While this perspective holds some validity, I strongly disagree with it for the following reasons.\nTo begin with, it is plausible to accept that some well-known individuals garner attention without significant career accomplishments. From a personal standpoint, these individuals may have inherited considerable wealth from their parents or possess striking physical attractiveness. The main reason they attract attention is often their conspicuous display of luxury items, including bags, clothing, jewelry, and the like. Moreover, the influence of their family backgrounds and associations with other famous figures who have achieved varying degrees of fame may have played a pivotal role in shaping their reputation. For instance, Paris Hilton, known for her lavish lifestyle, inherited a substantial fortune from the Hilton hotel chain established by her great-grandfather, Conrad Hilton, in the early 20th century. Therefore, the recognition she receives appears somewhat justified.\nNevertheless, I would argue that there are still many accomplished celebrities who positively contribute to our society. Firstly, by creating popular songs and engaging in exciting performances, these talented individuals have the ability to stimulate the neurons in people's brains, providing a means to alleviate anxiety and depression after a long and tiring day. Additionally, their involvement in entertainment can significantly boost the economy of their respective nations. To illustrate this point, consider the case of the Blackpink group, whose reputation extends globally due to their distinctive talents, appealing appearance, and captivating performances. This group has amassed a large international fan base, with numerous fans from around the world traveling to Korea to meet their idols. Consequently, these countries benefit economically from the entertainment industry, thus attracting more tourists and increasing their overall revenue.\nIn conclusion, while the notion of achieving fame primarily through factors other than personal accomplishments may not be ideal, I am convinced that it is more advantageous to allow famous individuals to find satisfaction in creating their careers based on their unique talents and contributions.\n"

From my personal perspective, I believe this development has both positive and negative aspects. I will present several reasons to support my viewpoint.\nOn one hand, the accessibility of products worldwide offers numerous advantages. One of the most significant benefits is the opportunity for cultural exchange. Specifically, it allows people to experience different cultures regardless of their geographical location. When individuals have access to similar products such as cuisine and clothing from various cultures, they can gain a valuable understanding and appreciation of traditional practices from around the world. For instance, in the past, the \"croissant\" was exclusively made in Western regions, particularly France. However, today, this type of bread is spreading globally, reaching a wide range of customers in places like Asia. Moreover, the globalization of products and services fosters innovation and intense competition among companies. To explain further, as businesses strive to meet global demand, they must continually improve the quality of their products to attract more customers. This ongoing trend can lead to the development of innovative products, resulting in economic growth and expansion for small enterprises. For example, Samsung, a Korean technology brand, consistently enhances the quality of its products and regularly releases state-of-the-art devices like the Z-fold 5, Z-flip 5, and Samsung S23 Ultra, which compete with Apple's offerings.\nOn the other hand, there are several disadvantages to this global trend that should not be overlooked. One of the most concerning consequences is the loss of cultural diversity. Exclusive products often carry unique cultural traits and instill a sense of pride within a community. Consequently, these products may no longer be valued or recognized as distinctive features of a particular tradition. Furthermore, the widespread availability of products across nations can lead to unemployment among indigenous populations. This stems from the fact that people tend to favor products from new and perceived as more prestigious brands. The proliferation of multinational goods and services can undermine the livelihoods of local producers, particularly those involved in traditional industries like clothing, food, toys, and cosmetics. Additionally, this trend can negatively impact tourism, as people may feel they have already been exposed to other nations' traditions in their own hometowns due to the homogenization of products. This could result in reduced willingness to spend on trips that offer experiences similar to what they have encountered before.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that the trend of product homogenization has numerous advantages, particularly in terms of product quality and innovation. However, strict measures should be taken to preserve the unique cultural features of societies around the world.\n"

While there may be some advantages for individuals, I believe that this trend primarily brings about negative consequences.\nOn one hand, the rise in competition can be advantageous for consumers. Competition among businesses in the market serves as a catalyst for the economic growth of a country. It is evident that in fiercely competitive markets, companies must strive to offer customers products of the highest quality at the most affordable prices. Consequently, consumers have a wider range of reasonable and favorable choices, leading to a variety of products and benefiting the nation's economy. In contrast, a monopolistic market devoid of competition not only disadvantages consumers but also manipulates the entire economy.\nOn the other hand, I am more inclined to view intense competition as an overall negative trend for several reasons. Firstly, the stress associated with competitiveness can adversely affect people's health and mental well-being. It is a well-established fact that employees in highly competitive work environments are more likely to experience work-related pressure. Those who work long hours and endure pressure from superiors, society, and the market are more susceptible to stress-related illnesses such as depression and anxiety disorders. For instance, in Japan, many cases of suicide each year are directly linked to the fierce competition and high-pressure work environment. Secondly, an excessive level of competition can create a toxic workplace for individuals. Within a company, having numerous excessively competitive employees can foster an unhealthy working atmosphere, leading to decreased productivity and discomfort among workers. Consequently, some employees may gradually seek better working conditions elsewhere.\nIn conclusion, while the escalation of competition in our society may bring economic benefits, I am more concerned about the adverse consequences associated with this phenomenon.\n"

I firmly believe that the advantages of higher education would far outweigh the drawbacks. At the individual level, when students have access to tertiary education, they become equipped with specialized knowledge, enabling them to pursue careers in fields like teaching, medicine, and engineering. Consequently, they are more likely to secure well-paying jobs and enhance their future quality of life.\nOn the other hand, I contend that it would be unwise to overlook the long-term disadvantages of this policy. On an individual level, when a substantial number of university students graduate, it could lead to a significant increase in unemployment rates. To elaborate, if a large number of candidates vie for the same job positions, not all will find employment. As a result, many individuals may opt for unrelated jobs to make ends meet. From a societal perspective, government budgets are finite. Therefore, excessive spending on education might divert resources away from crucial areas such as environmental preservation, healthcare systems, and food security, ultimately hindering sustainable development.\nIn conclusion, while the idea of state-funded university education is valid to some extent, I believe it could have negative repercussions for both individuals and society.

While this viewpoint holds merit to some extent, I hold the opinion that sports and music should also find a place in a student's education.\nOn one hand, there are several compelling reasons why I support this viewpoint to a certain extent. To commence, academic subjects such as mathematics and literature provide individuals with the foundational knowledge necessary for a seamless transition into the professional world. For instance, the logical thinking developed through math lessons and the critical thinking nurtured by literature are prerequisites for problem-solving skills. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that without exposure to such academic lessons, teenagers may lack the knowledge and skills required to pursue tertiary education and university-level courses. In Vietnam, for example, high school graduates are required to take a national exam at the outset of any university course.\nOn the other hand, it would be imprudent to underestimate the significance of athletic activities and music. Engaging in sports and playing musical instruments can have positive effects on both mental and physical health.

From my perspective, I strongly agree that the detrimental consequences associated with this trend far outweigh any of its benefits.\nFirst and foremost, an increasing number of beauty contests are likely to lower the quality of beauty queens. That is to say, by organizing numerous beauty competitions annually, judges and sponsors cannot comprehensively assess the attributes of beauty, leading to lower quality competitors. Consequently, this results in beauty contests losing their appeal.

This trend has led children to prefer chatting with their friends through their phones rather than engaging in face-to-face conversations with their parents.\nThese aforementioned factors have resulted in various adverse consequences. Firstly, the scarcity of quality family time is a major factor in the emergence of family problems. Specifically, reduced family time can widen emotional gaps among family members, leading to a deterioration in family bonds and potentially resulting in serious family issues, including domestic violence and, in extreme cases, divorce. Lastly, the lack of parental supervision can negatively affect children. For example, without proper guidance from their parents, children become more susceptible to exposure to harmful content on the Internet and can be negatively influenced by undesirable peer groups, which may lead them to develop distorted perspectives. This, in turn, can contribute to an increase in teenage crime rates.\nIn conclusion, there are underlying reasons behind the decline in family time, and these factors have led to several detrimental consequences. It is essential to address these issues to ensure healthier family relationships and a more positive societal impact.\n"

      "paragraph": "It is indeed true that online information has brought about a significant change in the way students acquire knowledge. Consequently, I fully support the notion that libraries have become obsolete in today's digital age.\nFirstly, accessing information online has become extremely convenient and time-efficient for students. For instance, the availability of search engines like Google enables them to swiftly search for any information they need on the internet, regardless of their location. Furthermore, the vast and diverse range of online knowledge caters to the requirements of students across various academic disciplines. As a result, there is no longer a necessity for them to invest time in visiting libraries and searching for specific books among numerous shelves.\nAnother crucial aspect to consider is the proliferation of online books, which has contributed to the redundancy of libraries. Many universities have established online platforms where students can access all the digital books necessary for their academic pursuits. This not only enhances the learning experience of students but also allows universities to do away with the burden of maintaining physical libraries, thereby saving substantial amounts of money. To illustrate, my own university provides students with complimentary access to download textbooks and reference materials from its website. Consequently, I can conveniently read these resources on my smartphone or laptop, which proves immensely helpful in completing assignments and preparing for dissertations.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that libraries have become obsolete in today's society due to the widespread availability of online knowledge, which is both convenient and time-saving for students. Additionally, the availability of digital books has empowered universities to eliminate libraries, offering their students a more streamlined and efficient means of studying through online resources.\n"

      "paragraph": "These days, it's becoming increasingly common for people to share their personal information online. While this practice can enhance the user experience, I believe it's more of a negative trend because it can leave people vulnerable to cybercrimes.\nOn the positive side, sharing personal information online can make online shopping a more convenient experience. When individuals link their personal details to their accounts on platforms like Amazon or Facebook, it streamlines the purchasing process. For instance, during the initial registration, when users sync their identity information with their sign-in accounts, it eliminates the need for time-consuming data entry. This means customers can skip the tedious steps and quickly proceed to complete their transactions, making the overall shopping experience more efficient.\nHowever, on the flip side, posting personal data on the internet can expose users to potential criminal activities. The private information shared online, including names, addresses, or social security numbers, can be exploited for illicit purposes, such as financial fraud. For example, there was a case in Vietnam where a hacker named \"Hieu PC\" operated one of the internet's most profitable services for selling stolen identity records. He used his social engineering skills to take advantage of vulnerable consumer data, stealing a large number of social security numbers and selling them on an anonymous online platform. This resulted in many retired workers in the United States losing millions of dollars to a sophisticated online hacking scheme.\nIn conclusion, despite some minor conveniences, sharing personal details online is a negative development due to the risk of online fraud. In my opinion, governments should establish additional privacy regulations for online shopping companies to reduce security risks and better protect personal identity information.\n"

      "question": "The double-edged sword of sports sponsorship: A critical analysis",
      "paragraph": "The topic of whether companies should promote their products through sports sponsorship is a subject of much debate. Some argue that it has a positive impact on the world of sports, while others believe it comes with disadvantages. In this essay, I will present both perspectives in an impartial manner and express my own viewpoint.\nThere are several reasons why sports events benefit from sponsorship by companies. Firstly, sports teams and athletes receive essential equipment that they might not otherwise afford. To elaborate, when companies wish to use athletes as endorsers for their products, they often provide the necessary tools and financial support to ensure that these athletes can effectively promote their products. Ultimately, these companies stand to gain significant profits, as the success of the athletes they sponsor can draw more attention to their brands. For instance, Nike has been supplying clothing and shoes to the France National Football Team for over a decade, resulting in more than 100 million dollars in revenue and a loyal following among the French population.\nOn the flip side, promoting products through athletes can have adverse effects on society. One of the primary concerns is that some companies endorse products that are harmful to health. To illustrate, there are businesses that offer sponsorship deals involving cigarette products for athletes. If fans of these athletes start using such products to show their support, it could lead to a society with higher rates of smoking. Furthermore, it can undermine efforts to reduce smoking rates among non-smokers. Another point to consider is that a player's misconduct or involvement in illegal activities can tarnish a company's reputation and financial standing. For instance, when a company associates itself with a sports figure who is embroiled in a scandal, it can face severe criticism from the public, resulting in financial losses and a loss of trust from customers. A recent example is the Jack Sparrow scandal in 2022, which caused Disney's value to plummet to a mere 50 million dollars, a mistake that still haunts the Hollywood Movie Studio.\nIn conclusion, the world of sports requires genuine investment from ethical businesses rather than subsidies from cigarette companies. Only through such investments can we ensure the long-term sustainability of the sports industry.\n"

      "paragraph": "Opinions are divided on whether students should enroll in academic courses that are helpful for their future careers, while others believe that they should take part in job training courses. In this essay, I will discuss both views before stating that both sides are equally important.\nOn one hand, there are compelling reasons why some people advocate for pursuing graduate school as the quickest route to success. To begin with, individuals become well-equipped with specialized knowledge in a specific field while studying at a higher education institute, which can lead to complex and high-paying job opportunities. A good example to illustrate this is that individuals who aspire to become doctors must invest at least 6 years in their college education; consequently, they tend to command higher salaries compared to other professions. Moreover, those with a university or bachelor's degree are more likely to secure promotions. Secondly, it is essential to have education experts specialized in specific fields to cultivate a well-educated workforce. This, in turn, contributes to increased work productivity and national economic development, freeing up resources for crucial areas such as healthcare and environmental protection.\nOn the other hand, some individuals may find it advantageous to begin participating in vocational training courses. Firstly, vocational training equips individuals with practical skills that enhance their work experience, allowing them to start earning a living sooner without dedicating four years to college. This immediate income can support them and their families. Secondly, the cost of university tuition can be exorbitant, especially in top-ranked institutions. Therefore, some individuals opt for job training courses to alleviate the financial burden on their families, enabling them to focus on their careers. Thirdly, there is often a demand for skilled workers in the labor market. Countries like Canada and Japan face shortages of unskilled laborers, prompting them to hire foreign workers, affecting their national budgets.\nIn summary, I have discussed both views and believe that both sides are equally important. Those who aim to enter the workforce quickly to support themselves and their families should consider attending job training courses, while those aspiring to careers as doctors, teachers, or white-collar professionals should pursue academic courses. By carefully weighing the pros and cons of each approach, individuals can make the best decision for their own lives.\n"

      "paragraph": "Many individuals emphasize the importance of local history for schoolchildren over that of world history. In my perspective, I respectfully disagree with this viewpoint as both are equally crucial for young learners.\nUndoubtedly, studying the history of one's hometown is an essential component of a school's curriculum during a student's early education. I firmly believe that gaining a profound understanding of past events in one's locality fosters a sense of patriotism. For instance, in my village, primary and secondary school children are educated about how their forebears defended their land against external intruders and reclaimed sovereignty. Consequently, these young children take pride in their heritage and cherish the life they currently enjoy. Additionally, I believe that it is not only a privilege but also a responsibility for students to be acquainted with their own history to comprehend their hometown's traditional values and identity.\nLooking at it from another perspective, learning about world history holds just as much significance as local history. Acquiring knowledge about past global events equips students with a more comprehensive perspective on life. Lessons on topics such as World War or the Feminist movement against women's abuse and discrimination contribute to enhancing the learners' understanding of various aspects of the world. Furthermore, I am of the opinion that being educated about the historical backgrounds of other countries can be beneficial for young learners in their future careers. Students who accumulate knowledge in this field at an early age would possess a valuable asset when seeking employment with foreign enterprises, especially those that place a high value on company culture, such as Japan.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the significance of domestic and international history cannot be compared to determine which one is more necessary, as they both hold distinct and equal importance for children.\n"

      "paragraph": "Opinions vary on whether the primary role of educational institutions is to mold students into responsible citizens and capable workers, rather than focusing on the individual benefits to children. I agree with this perspective, but I also believe that it is crucial to equip children to prosper individually.\nUndoubtedly, schools play a pivotal role in imparting discipline and skills that transform students into responsible citizens and productive employees. Teachers serve as guides, helping children distinguish right from wrong and guiding them toward making ethical choices in life. Once these moral lessons are absorbed, children develop strong principles and a deep awareness of the importance of contributing positively to society. Furthermore, since time immemorial, the fundamental purpose of education has been to broaden individuals' understanding; therefore, schools bear the responsibility of imparting essential knowledge and practical skills, enabling students to become knowledgeable and innovative workers in the job market.\nNevertheless, schools should also focus on benefiting children as individuals, as these institutions are instrumental in fostering emotional growth and unlocking their potential. Firstly, schools provide a platform for children to engage in early social interactions with their peers, which allows them to cultivate friendships and companionship. These social connections play a vital role in nurturing emotional development and well-being. Additionally, through their educational journey, children are exposed to various subjects and fields of study, providing them with opportunities to explore their interests and preferences. Consequently, schools fulfill their mission by nurturing students' strengths and addressing their weaknesses.\nIn conclusion, while it is argued that the primary function of schools should be to prepare children for responsible citizenship and employment, I agree that educational institutions should also fulfill their duty by enabling students to realize personal benefits and growth.\n"

      "paragraph": "As society continues to expand, the demand for energy resources like oil and gas is on the rise. Consequently, individuals may need to explore alternative energy sources located in distant and untouched areas. In my view, this course of action carries more drawbacks than advantages.\nDiscovering new energy sources in areas untouched by human presence may yield some immediate benefits. Firstly, these alternative sources can promptly alleviate the scarcity of fuel resources, such as gas, oil, and coal. It is evident that these fuels play a crucial role in meeting the daily energy needs of households and supporting industrial activities. Consequently, people can lead their daily lives smoothly, and businesses can operate efficiently. Secondly, uncovering new energy sources can also ease the financial burden on governments. In fact, prolonged energy shortages might compel governments to import these resources from other nations, substantially depleting national budgets.\nNevertheless, in addition to the aforementioned positive aspects, the exploration and exploitation of new energy sources may bring about significant adverse consequences for the environment and local communities. It is irrefutable that the environment is the primary casualty when exploitation begins. A telling example is the yearly quest by some countries in remote seas to discover oil and other gases in order to meet domestic market demands. Regrettably, in the course of these operations, they inadvertently devastate marine ecosystems, harming marine life like fish, coral reefs, and seaweed. Simultaneously, the livelihoods of local inhabitants are severely affected. Taking the damage in the oceans as a prime example, when the marine environment becomes contaminated, fishermen may lose their livelihoods due to the depletion of fish stocks. Consequently, they lose their primary source of income, often leading to financial hardships or even forcing them to abandon their homes in search of work elsewhere.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that the increasing demand for fuel resources compels us to seek alternative sources in remote or untouched areas.

In my view, this development has advantages and disadvantages.\nFirstly, the availability of entertainment on handheld devices offers numerous benefits. From an individual standpoint, video games and other forms of entertainment serve as excellent relaxation tools for individuals dealing with high levels of work-related stress. These convenient entertainment options enable people to unwind at their convenience, whether during breaks or after a taxing day at work, without affecting their productivity. Moreover, many mobile games help foster global communities among individuals who share common interests. For instance, PUBG Mobile has successfully hosted international events and competitions, connecting millions of players from around the world.\nWhile these advantages are noteworthy, excessive access to entertainment on handheld devices can lead to several detrimental consequences. Since video games can be addictive, many young people today spend excessive time on their devices, often isolating themselves from their families and friends. This lack of face-to-face interaction not only strains real-life relationships but also raises the risk of mental health issues among young people. Furthermore, when individuals invest significant amounts of time in video games, they tend to become less physically active, potentially leading to a society where people lead sedentary lifestyles. This lack of physical activity over time increases the susceptibility to metabolic diseases like obesity, straining a country's healthcare system and deteriorating overall health.\nIn conclusion, while the accessibility of entertainment on portable devices can pose various health risks, it can also serve as an effective stress reliever for many individuals and facilitate the networking of like-minded people worldwide.\n"

I respectfully disagree with this notion, as I believe that these technological tools offer valuable benefits while acknowledging the potential risks of overreliance on them.\nFirstly, I argue that digital devices provide valuable assistance to young individuals seeking to enhance their writing skills. Many word processing and writing applications available on computers and mobile phones come equipped with features such as spell-check and grammar correction. These features can be highly beneficial for young people, as they help in improving the quality of their essays and reports. For instance, the application Grammarly, which serves as a writing assistant, assists users in identifying and rectifying errors in their writing. Moreover, it offers suggestions related to sentence structure, vocabulary choices, and tone, ultimately enhancing the accuracy and readability of their compositions.\nAnother compelling reason to support my stance is that these devices grant easy access to a vast array of reading materials. The internet, in particular, offers an extensive range of written sources, including news articles, blogs, and online books. This accessibility exposes young people to various writing styles, genres, and perspectives, thereby contributing to the improvement of their literacy skills. To illustrate, young students, in addition to their traditional textbooks, can explore e-books and online news articles on their computers. This exposure allows them to gain a deeper understanding of various subjects, such as gender equality, empowering them to craft more persuasive essays on such topics.\nNevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that an over-dependence on technological devices can potentially have a detrimental impact on the literacy skills of young individuals. The prevalence of autocorrect functions on computers and mobile phones may reduce their motivation to learn correct spelling and grammar. Consequently, there is a risk that they may become overly reliant on these functions, leading to reduced confidence in their writing abilities.\nIn conclusion, I maintain that the use of computers and mobile phones can significantly enhance young people's literacy skills due to the availability of valuable tools and a wealth of reading materials. However, it is important to be cautious about the potential negative consequences, such as over-dependence on electronic devices. To strike a balance, it is advisable for young individuals to use these devices regularly but also regulate the amount of time spent on them in order to cultivate their writing and reading expertise.\n"

This essay aims to highlight the reasons for the reduced family time and its effects.\nThere are two primary reasons for the decline in family time nowadays. Firstly, demanding work schedules have taken away the time that could be spent with loved ones. For instance, an average blue-collar worker in Vietnam may need to work additional hours, typically around 30 hours per week, to adequately support their family. This has directly resulted in a significant reduction in their time at home, leading to a substantial decline in the quality of family time. Additionally, the excessive use of technological devices is also contributing to this trend. This perception is reinforced by the prevalence of instant communication through social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, which encourages children to prefer chatting with friends on their phones over face-to-face conversations with their parents.\nThe aforementioned reasons have led to a variety of negative consequences. Firstly, the scarcity of quality family time is primarily responsible for several family problems.

Although this statement is valid to a certain extent, I think that proactive measures and efforts to mitigate and combat climate change are essential for the long-term well-being of our planet and future generations.\nAs people live with climate change, they seem to have gotten used to the challenges it causes; therefore, they have developed solutions to protect themselves. To be more specific, when it comes to hurricane season, they monitor the weather forecast and come up with plans to protect their homes, such as reinforcing their houses and evacuating to a safe place. Nearly all regions of the world are experiencing more hot days and heatwaves, so to deal with UV damage to the skin, they've developed shading methods such as wearing hats, protective clothing, masks, gloves, and sunscreen to protect their skin. The case in Vietnam is a perfect example of this situation. Every time the flood season comes, people in the Mekong Delta build dikes to protect their houses, fields, and gardens. When the floodwaters recede, they leave behind an abundant amount of fertile alluvium, which enriches the soil in people's fields. In addition, the floods bring rich seafood, allowing people to earn extra income by catching and selling them to traders. This is why some people lean towards the above opinion. However, I believe that we can work to find measures to combat climate change instead of simply adapting to it.\nNotwithstanding the aforementioned argument supporting living with climate change, I believe that the following solutions could be more effective. First and foremost, taking action to mitigate climate change is crucial because it addresses the root causes of the problem. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and promoting sustainable practices such as tree planting, we can minimize the severity of climate change and prevent further environmental degradation. This approach is essential for ensuring a sustainable future and avoiding irreversible consequences. Moreover, the government should impose heavy penalties for acts of environmental destruction and invest in environmentally friendly public transport systems to reduce CO2 emissions. By actively promoting environmental education and discouraging littering, we can mitigate climate change and help preserve important ecosystems, such as coral reefs and forests, as well as human life.\nIn conclusion, although the idea of co-existing with climate change has its merits, I believe that the proposals mentioned above could be more effective.

However, I believe that a well-defined dress code ultimately affects the quality of work by ensuring workplace safety, contributing to branding, and fostering a cohesive work environment.\nTo begin with, establishing clear uniform guidelines that match the nature of the job and ensure employee safety can enhance productivity and work quality. For example, in construction sites, when workers wear safety equipment like goggles or helmets, they can avoid potential accidents. In this way, emphasizing dress code regulations promotes the overall well-being of staff, which can directly impact the quality of their work. Furthermore, when employees feel safe, they can contribute to their career objectives with confidence, potentially leading to significant improvements in productivity.\nAnother reason to support dress codes is their importance in shaping an organization's brand. Consider airlines like Emirates, for instance. Their strict dress code for staff contributes to their premium and professional brand image, which, in turn, fosters customer trust and satisfaction. This trust leads to repeat and referral business, ultimately having a positive impact on the quality of work. Additionally, having a dress code instills a sense of pride in employees who feel they represent the brand. This sense of pride promotes better collaboration among team members and a shared commitment to delivering outstanding service.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that employers should consider dress codes in the workplace.

Some individuals argue that allocating a substantial portion of the budget to enhance the speed of public transportation is essential. Conversely, others advocate for diverting these funds towards different priorities, such as cost reduction and environmental preservation. In this essay, I aim to explore both perspectives and present my own viewpoint.\nTo commence with, it is worth noting the advantages of investing in faster public transportation systems. Firstly, the introduction of swift modes of travel has significantly reduced commuting time for the general populace, especially for daily commuters. Consequently, people can enjoy more leisure time, which can enhance their overall productivity at work. Secondly, the adoption of various modes of transportation has alleviated the issue of overcrowded and uncomfortably hot buses. As a result, individuals no longer need to rush to catch a bus or wake up excessively early to secure a seat, allowing them to better prepare for work or school and enjoy a leisurely breakfast with their family.\nOn the other hand, there are several compelling arguments in favor of allocating government funds to eco-friendly transportation systems. Primarily, it is imperative that the government invests in environmentally sustainable transportation options due to the excessive consumption of natural resources, such as oil and fuel, associated with personal vehicles. By promoting eco-friendly modes of transport, we can reduce traffic congestion and minimize air pollution, ultimately benefiting the environment. Moreover, in an era characterized by rising inflation, it becomes crucial for the government to lower transportation costs to ensure that public transport remains accessible to all. This, in turn, prevents an increase in prices for essential goods and services reliant on efficient transportation.\nFurthermore, it is essential to consider other critical areas where government expenditure is vital, including healthcare, clean drinking water, and education.\nIn conclusion, while improved transportation methods offer numerous long-term benefits, we cannot disregard their potential impacts on costs and the environment.

In this essay, we will explore both perspectives and provide our own viewpoint.\nOn one hand, it is my belief that companies bear a significant responsibility in minimizing the packaging of their products. One rationale for this is that many consumers may not fully grasp the adverse effects of excessive product packaging on the environment. Therefore, manufacturers and supermarkets should strive to reduce the use of plastic packaging or, ideally, utilize biodegradable, recyclable, or environmentally friendly materials. Furthermore, a considerable portion of the population may not have the means to be selective in their product choices. This underscores the need for all companies to act responsibly.\nOn the other hand, individuals also play a crucial role in safeguarding the environment against further harm and pollution by reducing their consumption of products packaged in non-biodegradable materials. By boycotting products from companies that do not exhibit environmental responsibility, consumers can exert pressure on these entities to change their packaging practices. Consequently, companies will be compelled to adopt more environmentally responsible approaches and reduce their packaging. While consumers possess the power to effect change, collective action is necessary for it to materialize.\nIn conclusion, both companies and individuals share the responsibility for the amount of packaging used in product packaging.

Let's delve into the reasons behind this viewpoint in the following essay.\nReading for enjoyment can significantly aid individuals in nurturing their imagination and enhancing their language skills. Firstly, it's widely acknowledged that watching television tends to be a more passive activity, whereas reading is inherently an active form of learning. Reading engages one's cognitive faculties more actively as readers must employ their imagination to visualize the characters and storyline. This process, in turn, contributes to the development of their imaginative thinking skills.\nSecondly, language skills can also be markedly improved through regular reading. By making reading a habit, individuals can naturally expand their vocabulary and acquire a better understanding of various grammatical structures, learning how to employ them effectively.\nConversely, watching TV has limited potential to boost imagination and language skills. When people read, they have ample time to immerse themselves in the text, mentally creating images from the content. In contrast, television provides viewers with little opportunity for imagination since the visuals are presented directly on the screen. Additionally, the dialogues in TV shows or movies are often delivered at a brisk pace, leaving viewers with insufficient time to grasp and learn new information.\nFurthermore, contemporary television is rife with advertisements, which can be quite distracting. This constant interruption diverts the viewers' attention from the content they are watching, making it even more challenging for them to absorb any information that could potentially enhance their language skills.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that reading books constitutes a more effective approach for individuals to enrich their imagination and language proficiency.

      "paragraph": "Some individuals argue that a significant amount of time and financial resources are dedicated to the protection of wild animals, suggesting that these resources would be better utilized for the benefit of the human population. I strongly disagree with this viewpoint due to the indispensable role of animals in maintaining ecosystem balance and enriching the diversity of the natural world.\nMy primary reason for holding this position is the crucial role that wildlife plays in preserving the equilibrium of the ecosystem. To elaborate, wildlife forms an interconnected chain, with each species having intricate relationships with one another. Consequently, if one species of wild animal were to become extinct or disappear, it could have ripple effects on others. For instance, fish typically serve as the primary food source for many bird species. Therefore, if fish populations decline or vanish, numerous bird species may face food shortages. Consequently, wild animals play a pivotal role in sustaining the ecosystem.\nAnother significant justification for my stance is that wild species serve as invaluable subjects for the groundbreaking research conducted by scientists. Presently, humanity faces numerous threats from contagious diseases such as COVID-19, HIV, and AIDS. Consequently, scientists are constantly in a race against time to develop vaccines for these diseases. In this critical process, animals are essential for testing the safety and effectiveness of vaccines before they are administered to humans. Hence, animals have been instrumental in helping scientists create medicines that can potentially save the lives of millions of people.\nIn conclusion, I firmly disagree with the assertion that resources dedicated to wildlife conservation should be redirected toward the human population. This is because of the vital role that wildlife plays in maintaining ecosystem balance and the significant contributions they make to advancements in human health through scientific research.\n"

      "paragraph": "In recent years, due to global human development, there has been a noticeable degradation and decline in our natural environment. Several factors contribute to this, but I believe that there are viable solutions to address these issues.\nOn one hand, there are numerous reasons explaining why our environment is deteriorating in today's society. Firstly, the combustion of fossil fuels by companies and the exhaust emissions from private vehicles like cars and motorbikes have significantly increased the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, leading to more severe air pollution. This, in turn, has resulted in global warming and climate change, causing rising temperatures and the eventual submergence of coastal cities. Consequently, the Earth faces an increased frequency of natural disasters such as tropical storms and floods. Secondly, the rapid economic development has led to a population explosion and improved living standards. This has driven mass production of low-cost goods to meet growing demands, resulting in water and land pollution. Large-scale deforestation for purposes such as agriculture, logging, urbanization, and infrastructure development has further contributed to habitat destruction, loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and elevated carbon dioxide levels.\nOn the other hand, there are effective measures that can be implemented to combat these issues. Firstly, governments should enact and enforce stringent environmental protection laws. Individuals who violate these laws through activities like littering, deforestation, or poaching should face heavy penalties. Additionally, authorities should impose substantial taxes on companies that produce unsustainable products. Moreover, companies can invest in waste disposal treatment systems to ensure that harmful substances are properly managed before release into the environment. Public awareness and education campaigns are crucial in addressing environmental concerns. Governments, educational institutions, and organizations should invest in environmental education programs to instill a sense of responsibility and promote sustainable practices among individuals and communities.\nIn conclusion, while human development has undeniably taken a toll on our natural environment, it is within our power to reverse this trend. By implementing stricter regulations, promoting responsible behavior, and investing in sustainable practices, we can pave the way for a more environmentally friendly future.\n"

      "paragraph": "Many people argue that young individuals should allocate more time to their families, while others believe they should engage in outdoor and commercial activities. From my perspective, I don't strongly support either of these ideas. In the following paragraphs, I will explore both sides of this issue.\nFirstly, in today's fast-paced world, students often have limited time to spend with their parents due to their demanding university schedules. The period during which children grow from toddlers to high school students is crucial for building a strong bond with their parents. For instance, many Vietnamese students relocate from rural areas to major cities like Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi to pursue higher education. Consequently, they are unable to live with their parents due to the long distance. Therefore, children and students should consider dedicating more time to their parents while they still can, as they may regret missing out on these moments later in life.\nOn the other hand, even when students live with their parents, it is important for them to engage in social activities, such as playing sports or spending time with friends. Individuals who avoid social interactions are at a higher risk of becoming introverted or experiencing depression when facing challenging situations in life. This can hinder their mental and emotional well-being and make them reluctant to communicate with others. By actively participating in social activities, students not only improve their mental and physical health but also acquire valuable soft skills that prepare them for adulthood.\nIn conclusion, while engaging in social activities offers numerous benefits to young individuals, spending time with family is equally essential. In my final opinion, students should strike a balance between time spent with their family and participation in social activities to achieve a well-rounded development.\n"

      "paragraph": "The increasing popularity of adopting healthy diets and engaging in regular exercise can be attributed to the influence of mass media. To further promote this trend, we can consider implementing certain strategies, such as introducing physical activity requirements in schools and imposing taxes on processed foods.\nThe growing awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle is largely due to the widespread impact of mass media. Nowadays, it is commonplace to watch movies and television shows featuring celebrities who are in great shape. This implicitly sets new standards of beauty that many people believe they can attain. Consequently, audiences often try to research and emulate the diet and exercise routines of these well-known figures, aiming to improve their own health. This phenomenon can be readily observed in various health magazines like Men?? Health and Women?? Health, which cater to this desire by publishing the daily fitness routines and meal plans of these celebrities. Fans can easily access these magazines online and adopt these routines, learning valuable practices from successful role models to consistently maintain good health.\nIn order for this trend to continue growing, it is essential for the government to take decisive actions. First, legislation should be introduced mandating an increase in physical activities within school curriculums. These activities can include sports like football, basketball, as well as typical exercises like jogging. By providing additional opportunities for schoolchildren to engage in physical activities, the overall fitness level of the nation's population can be better maintained in the long term. The second measure involves the implementation of taxes on processed food products. By imposing such taxes, consumers may become more hesitant to purchase these items due to the higher cost. Consequently, this reform could encourage individuals to opt for naturally produced foods, promoting healthier eating habits.\nIn conclusion, the surge in the adoption of healthy lifestyles can be largely attributed to mass media influence. To further promote this positive trend, it is crucial to introduce compulsory physical education in schools and impose taxes on processed foods. It is important to ensure that these measures remain affordable to encourage widespread adoption among the population.\n"

In this essay, I will discuss the possible reasons for this trend and suggest methods to encourage more people to adopt a healthier lifestyle.\nThere are two key reasons behind the growing preference for exercise and a balanced diet. Firstly, people today are more informed about the connection between their lifestyle choices and their well-being. Information is readily available, and individuals can quickly access knowledge about the impact of nutrition and physical activity on their health. Consequently, habits that contribute to a healthier life have become more popular. Secondly, living conditions have improved, leading individuals to allocate resources to matters like their appearance. It is a fact that a nutritious diet is more expensive than fast food, so only those who can afford it tend to invest in improving their lifestyles.\nAs healthy eating and exercise offer significant benefits to individuals' well-being, several methods can be employed to motivate people to embrace this trend. Firstly, making physical activities mandatory in schools and workplaces can help transform sedentary individuals into more active ones. Regardless of the duration of the exercise, the mere act of getting people up and moving can lead to the formation of a habit of physical activity over time. Furthermore, governments can provide free exercise facilities, such as communal gyms, to all citizens, particularly those with limited financial means, to encourage participation. Lastly, reducing taxes on healthy foods can promote their consumption over unhealthy options like fast food.\nIn conclusion, the increased awareness due to easy access to information and improved living conditions are driving the interest in healthier lifestyles.

Personally, I believe that both attributes are crucial, and children should strive to balance them.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that competition is a fundamental aspect of life, and sports can be instrumental in teaching children about it. Many parents believe that by participating in competitive environments, children can learn how to maintain determination to achieve their goals and strive for success. In individual sports, youngsters must cultivate a strong fighting spirit and a resilient mindset to overcome numerous setbacks since they have to contend alone without any teammates for support.\nOn the other hand, youngsters can develop their collaboration skills through sports. Collaboration is crucial, as the overall success of each team hinges on how players support each other. Children who play team sports can learn how to communicate effectively and build relationships with their teammates. Furthermore, youngsters can also learn that, instead of solely focusing on their individual achievements, they should share responsibilities to aim for better results. For instance, in a football match, players must exhibit good coordination, understand their teammates, and work together to score goals.\nIn conclusion, sports offer children the opportunity to develop both competition and teamwork skills. While competition imparts essential individual skills and teaches children how to navigate setbacks independently, teamwork instills social skills, such as effective communication and a sense of collective achievement.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's world, as humans continue to vigorously pursue economic and cultural expansion, there is ongoing debate regarding whether the increasing global trade and cultural interactions are advantageous for overall prosperity or if they lead to the diminishment of unique national characteristics. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives before expressing my inclination towards the former.\nOn one hand, it is understandable why some individuals hold the notion that due to international business and cultural exchange, their nation's distinct identity may become diluted. To commence, the borderless nature of commerce underscores the importance of a common international language, given that the world has transformed into a global community where people from diverse regions communicate in a shared tongue. Consequently, this close connection between transnational trade and the fading of less widely spoken languages is evident.\nOn the other hand, proponents of enhanced commercial and cultural interactions among nations argue that it fosters comprehension and cooperation between countries. Strengthened trade partnerships facilitate the exchange of goods, services, and technology, ultimately fostering economic prosperity for all parties involved. For instance, the ease of cross-border communication and collaboration has enabled businesses to expand their global market reach, leading to economic advancement and increased employment opportunities. Additionally, cultural exchange initiatives and international events promote an appreciation of diverse traditions, thus fostering mutual respect and harmony among nations.\nIn conclusion, the development of commercial and cultural ties between countries undoubtedly yields benefits by fostering mutual understanding, stimulating economic growth, and encouraging global cooperation. Nevertheless, we must also remain mindful of the potential impact on the national identity and cultural diversity of smaller nations. While we encourage international trade facilitation and agreements, it is imperative that we make concerted efforts to preserve the cultural and ethnic identities that make each nation unique.\n"

From my perspective, I think there are specific types of buildings that should be preserved, and I believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\nTo begin with, buildings with significant cultural and historical significance should be preserved. These may include old churches, temples, history museums, religious structures, landmarks, or castles. All of these serve as testaments to a region's rich history and cultural heritage. By doing so, we not only maintain a connection to our history but also enhance the aesthetic quality of a city, attracting more tourism from around the world. Furthermore, historical buildings contribute to instilling pride in citizens for their own country and other nations.\nOn the contrary, preserving old buildings also presents its challenges. Firstly, maintaining and preserving old buildings can be prohibitively expensive. For instance, many old buildings require substantial financial investments to restore them to a structurally sound condition. These funds could otherwise be directed towards pressing needs like infrastructure development and public services. Moreover, preservation efforts might impede economic growth, potentially leading to reduced job opportunities and economic prosperity in the region.\nIn conclusion, I believe that historic structures should be prioritized for preservation and protection.

In this essay, I am going to discuss the reasoning of both views before I am inclined to believe that robots have negative effects on humans in society.\nOn the one hand, factories often employ robots to enhance production efficiency. Using robots can help people save time and money. Factory owners don't need to spend time on hiring and managing workers. Besides, excessive workload can lead to stress among individuals, so robots present a beneficial solution.\nOn the other hand, robots have the capacity to transform various aspects of society. For instance, in education, robots can assist in teaching, and in the workforce, some jobs like those in IT, reception, and office work can be automated. While robots indeed play an important role, they should not be viewed as the primary driving force behind society's progress. Humans remain the primary agents for positive change in the world. If we excessively rely on robots to handle everything, we risk becoming complacent and detached from the emotional aspects of work. Therefore, we should not overly depend on robots. In my opinion, while robots can contribute to certain tasks, it is humans who possess the ability to create and shape every aspect of our society.\nIn conclusion, I am inclined to believe that robots can have negative effects on humans in society, but it ultimately depends on how humans choose to integrate and use this technology.

While some believe that this growth in tourism creates new job opportunities for local people, others think that it endangers the natural environment, especially wildlife habitats. This essay seeks to discuss the impact of tourism in relation to its advantages and disadvantages.\nOn one hand, tourists require services such as transportation, accommodation, and food and beverages. Therefore, local residents can boost the local economy through providing cuisine or renting out their houses, which can enhance their quality of life. This is exemplified by large companies that offer services to tourists to ensure they have an unforgettable experience in the landscape. This can lead to more business opportunities and cultural collaborations in the long term, fostering the development of the national economy and investing in the improvement of both the landscapes and service quality. As a result, residents can earn a living by working for such organizations as tour guides with well-paid salaries. Furthermore, the development of tourism also helps local people showcase their traditions and cultures. For example, tourists visit Bat Trang village, which is traditionally renowned for its pottery-making, to buy souvenirs or experience how to make pottery. Therefore, the workshop's owner can promote its tradition and culture through handicrafts to tourists from all over the world.\nHowever, mass tourism can have a detrimental impact on the environment. Overcrowding, pollution, and the construction of tourism infrastructure can harm fragile ecosystems and damage natural beauty. Travelers often use private vehicles, such as cars and motorcycles, which has a noticeable impact on the environment as these vehicles emit gases and fumes, causing pollution. This negatively affects animals, particularly endangered species that live in such polluted environments, leading to lung diseases and the risk of wildlife habitats becoming extinct. In addition, not only do animals suffer, but people also face challenges. Popular tourist destinations struggle to cope with the strain on their infrastructure, leading to issues like traffic congestion. If these issues are not addressed, they could result in an increase in accidents, causing people to suffer the loss of their loved ones, which is the most devastating consequence.\nFrom my perspective, I firmly believe that the disadvantages of tourism outweigh its advantages because the well-being of both wildlife and people is of utmost importance compared to any benefits that tourism brings.\nIn conclusion, the growth of tourism has made a substantial contribution to the economic development of a country and the quality of local life.

Indeed, some buildings may boast a beautiful exterior but neglect the structural integrity of the interior. Consequently, such structures may lack the necessary robustness, potentially endangering occupants in the event of a collapse. Moreover, an excessively extravagant exterior design can create discomfort among people. As an illustration, in Binh Duong province, Vietnam, a wealthy individual constructed a tower adorned with a brightly painted dragon-shaped fa?ade.

One of the most significant advantages is that it helps people access accurate and specific knowledge. To clarify, individuals can gain valuable knowledge and improve their social skills while engaging with social media. Consequently, their awareness is enhanced, and they gain a more comprehensive understanding of various aspects of life. Another benefit is that social media facilitates stronger connections among individuals. Platforms like Facebook play a pivotal role as bridges that enable people to communicate conveniently and swiftly, particularly those who come from different parts of the world. People can also make use of helpful features such as video calls and photo sharing through social media.

In my view, people should prioritize acquiring practical skills that enhance their employability, rather than pursuing purely academic courses.\nOn the one hand, there are several compelling reasons for choosing university education. Firstly, possessing a university degree significantly improves one's prospects of securing a well-paying job, as many companies now consider it a standard criterion for admission and employee selection. In countries like Vietnam, for instance, large corporations typically require candidates to hold a university degree along with relevant certifications. Furthermore, university programs often include management courses, which can pave the way for future leadership roles.\nOn the other hand, there are strong arguments in favor of vocational training. One key advantage is the shorter duration of these courses; vocational programs typically last around two years or even less in some cases, including online options. Consequently, graduates can enter the job market more quickly and find positions that align with their skills. Notably, vocational schools frequently collaborate with businesses, facilitating job placements for their graduates.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that students should consider vocational training as a viable path to secure suitable employment opportunities swiftly, thereby addressing the global workforce demand.\n"

      "paragraph": "It is indeed true that the advancement of science plays a critical role in enhancing the quality of people's lives. I agree that science should contribute to improving human lives, but I also believe that preserving a sustainable ecosystem is equally important in the realm of scientific development.\nOn one hand, as science progresses, it leads to the invention of new medicines and treatments. Many illnesses that caused numerous deaths in the past due to a lack of suitable treatments, such as Covid-19 or malaria, can now be effectively cured with the help of medications. Consequently, individuals can extend their lifespan and experience a higher quality of life. Furthermore, science offers opportunities for individuals to enhance their appearance through beauty technology and plastic surgery. This increased attractiveness boosts people's self-confidence and opens up more life and career opportunities. For instance, consider the case of Duc Phuc, a young and renowned singer in Vietnam. Initially lacking a striking appearance, which is a significant hurdle for aspiring singers, he decided to undergo plastic surgery to enhance his looks. This transformation garnered more attention from the audience and significantly contributed to his success.\nOn the other hand, it is crucial to recognize that the primary goal of science should not only be to improve people's lives but also to focus on the environment and the ecosystem, which are under threat due to human activities. With increasing population density, the number of vehicles on the roads has risen, leading to severe environmental pollution. To address this issue, scientists have developed electric motors, which have substantially reduced carbon dioxide emissions from transportation. This innovation has also contributed to the narrowing of holes in the ozone layer. Additionally, the invention of solar panels and wind turbines has proven to be a more environmentally friendly method of electricity generation compared to nuclear power and fossil fuels. These traditional sources of energy release polluted water and gases during the manufacturing process, adversely affecting the environment. As a result, the habitats of various animal species are protected, leading to an enhancement in ecosystem diversity.\nIn conclusion, while improving the quality of people's lives remains a significant goal of science, we must not overlook the pressing environmental concerns that demand our attention. Balancing scientific progress with environmental preservation is essential, both now and in the future.\n"

While this viewpoint has some merit, I firmly believe that cellphones still play a crucial role in our lives.\nOn one hand, there are valid reasons for prohibiting mobile phones. Firstly, excessive smartphone usage can lead to dependency. It is evident that many people spend a significant amount of time on social media, which can negatively impact their health and even affect their nervous system. Moreover, excessive smartphone use can desensitize individuals in their interactions with relatives, making it crucial for people to learn how to use cellphones responsibly and in moderation. Secondly, the availability of numerous applications for download on smartphones can make students lazier and tempt them to cheat in exams. Therefore, it is essential for families and schools to closely monitor and regulate their usage.\nOn the other hand, there are numerous advantages to mobile phones. Firstly, they serve as valuable tools for seeking information and expanding knowledge, assisting in experiments, and facilitating various projects. Without smartphones, many of these tasks would be significantly more challenging. Secondly, smartphones provide a convenient platform for job hunting and earning income. They allow us to easily find both part-time and full-time employment opportunities with varying wages and salaries, eliminating the need to physically visit multiple locations to submit resumes; instead, we can accomplish everything from the comfort of our homes.\nIn conclusion, while the argument for restricting smartphones in certain public places has its merits, I believe that cellphones continue to play a vital role in our lives.

While this assertion holds some truth, I contend that success depends on more than just economic development.\nUndoubtedly, financial progress is viewed as a fundamental objective for any nation. Firstly, a healthy and strong economy generates employment opportunities across all sectors and promotes overall development. Consequently, citizens may secure decent jobs with attractive compensation packages, leading to an improved quality of life. For instance, Switzerland, ranked as the world's most economically stable country, boasts low unemployment, a high GDP per capita, and the highest living standards globally. Secondly, economic growth provides additional resources for the government to invest in infrastructure development and public services, thereby strengthening the nation.\nHowever, it would be unjustifiable to attribute a country's prosperity solely to economic growth. Clearly, other factors also contribute significantly to a nation's global standing. Firstly, education plays a vital role in equipping citizens with the knowledge and skills necessary for the workforce, thereby enhancing their economic prospects and overall well-being. Secondly, health and environmental sustainability are essential aspects that demand government attention. To elaborate, when residents have access to quality healthcare and live in a safe and clean environment, their welfare is greatly enhanced. Ultimately, a nation's success should be gauged by the wealth, well-being, and happiness of its citizens.\nIn conclusion, I maintain that economic growth is indeed a reflection of a country's achievements.

I think that a well-defined dress code can actually have a positive impact on the quality of work by ensuring safety, enhancing branding, and promoting a harmonious work environment.\nTo begin with, implementing appropriate dress codes that match the nature of the jobs can lead to increased productivity and better work quality. In certain industries, such as manufacturing or healthcare, it may be necessary to have strict uniform requirements to ensure the safety and well-being of employees. For example, construction workers need to wear safety gear like goggles and helmets to prevent accidents. By emphasizing dress code regulations, we can reduce risks and improve the overall health and safety of employees, which can directly influence their professional performance. Furthermore, when employees feel safe, they are more likely to contribute effectively to their career goals, leading to a significant boost in productivity.\nAnother important point is that having a dress code is crucial for an organization's branding. Let's take the example of airlines like Emirates. Their rigorous dress code for staff members contributes to their premium and professional brand image. This, in turn, builds trust and satisfaction among customers, resulting in repeat business and referrals, ultimately enhancing the quality of work. Additionally, having a dress code instills a sense of pride in employees who feel they represent the brand. This sense of pride promotes better teamwork and a shared commitment to delivering excellent service.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that employers should consider implementing dress codes in the workplace. The importance of dress codes at work depends on the nature of the profession, improvements in the company's reputation, and the sense of pride that employees develop in representing the organization.\n"

Learning online with their phones bridges the gap between them and other typical students.\nSecondly, having a mobile phone on hand is crucial in many special emergencies. For instance, if someone gets lost and doesn't know how to reach their destination, they can call their relatives for assistance or use Google Maps for guidance. People who are far away from their loved ones can use these devices to stay connected and inquire about their well-being and daily activities.\nOn the flip side, there are also several negative aspects to consider. The most significant one is that excessive mobile phone use can harm interpersonal relationships. For example, when a family goes to a restaurant to have a meal, they often spend more time glued to their smartphone screens than engaging in face-to-face conversation. While using these technologies to connect with others is not inherently improper, it often comes at the expense of meaningful in-person communication.

While this viewpoint holds merit in certain respects, I maintain that it can yield some positive effects on human relationships in specific scenarios.\nOn one hand, there are several reasons behind the belief that technological advancements can harm interpersonal relationships. First and foremost, an increasing number of individuals prefer using social networks like Facebook and Viber to communicate with their families and friends instead of engaging in face-to-face meetings. Consequently, they become overly reliant on communication technologies and miss opportunities to enhance their real-world communication skills. Secondly, when people communicate via phones or laptops, they are more prone to misunderstandings compared to in-person interactions, as they cannot convey their emotions and intentions as effectively. In fact, numerous instances exist where human relationships have been compromised due to misunderstandings stemming from these communication technologies.\nOn the other hand, I firmly believe that it would be unwise to underestimate the substantial benefits of communication technology. Firstly, it has made it exceptionally convenient to connect with people worldwide. Thanks to the prevalence of social media and messaging apps, individuals can now communicate with family, friends, and colleagues in real time, regardless of their geographic location. Consequently, this facilitates collaboration among people even when they are separated by great distances.

While it is undeniable that academic studies offer substantial benefits for individuals, I wholeheartedly agree that there is a pressing need to encourage more people to pursue careers as manual workers.\nTo begin with, there are two compelling reasons why promoting vocational training is imperative. Firstly, the presence of skilled professionals such as electricians and plumbers is indispensable in the construction and maintenance of buildings. For instance, essential facilities like hospitals and schools require regular renovation and upkeep. Employing well-trained workers for these tasks not only ensures the safety and longevity of these structures but also enhances the overall quality of life within the community. Moreover, it is evident that some countries are currently witnessing an oversaturation of academic graduates in specific majors, leading to a steep rise in graduate unemployment rates each year. Consequently, authorities in these nations must prioritize providing additional vocational training opportunities.\nMore people should be encouraged to attend career-oriented courses to meet society's needs. Schools should not solely focus on exam-driven curricula, which are often impractical and demotivate students when they receive low grades. Therefore, schools must make changes in the curriculum and provide workshops to teach practical skills. Parents should also encourage their children to discover their talents and explain the promising job prospects to inspire them to choose vocational careers.\nIn conclusion, I firmly support the idea that encouraging more individuals to pursue vocational training is essential.

Some argue that advertising is highly effective in persuading people to make purchases. However, there is a compelling argument that the proliferation of advertisements can lead to people ignoring them. In this essay, I will elaborate on both perspectives and provide my own opinion.\nOn the one hand, advertising trends can indeed influence target audiences to purchase products, as most commercials strive to attract more customers. Many advertisements are visually appealing and captivating, designed with great care. Moreover, numerous companies use persuasive language in their product advertisements to entice a wider audience with compelling scripts. For example, take the well-known fast-food brand, KFC. It is evident that this brand has been successful in persuading individuals through their enticing advertising videos and images featuring delectable pieces of chicken and crispy fried potatoes. As a result, KFC has become one of the most popular fast-food chains globally, particularly in the USA. Consequently, many renowned brands can achieve remarkable success through their advertising strategies.\nOn the other hand, due to their frequent appearance on social media, advertisements may not capture the full attention of viewers. The primary reason is that commercials gradually become a distraction while viewers are engrossed in other content. Furthermore, people tend to skip or ignore advertisements without paying much attention to their content. According to a recent survey, people have claimed that numerous advertisements sometimes hinder their enjoyment of videos on YouTube, leading them to disregard these ads. Hence, despite their attractive strategies, advertisements often result in negative effects on audiences.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that advertising can sometimes provide viewers with a negative experience.

Advancements in technology have made it easier than ever to satisfy this curiosity. But what motivates people to delve into the past?\nTo begin with, our fast-paced lives often leave little room for tranquility and introspection. Many, particularly the youth, struggle to find their footing in this whirlwind of existence. Having a profound understanding of the world around them can instill a sense of confidence in the face of life's impermanence. Furthermore, the adage \"knowing the past can change the future\" holds true. To aspire to a better life and a more comfortable environment, individuals must delve into the history of their homes, aiming to avoid repeating past mistakes.\nFortunately, we have various tools at our disposal to undertake this historical exploration. While libraries may seem old-fashioned and less convenient in today's digital age, they contain invaluable resources. There are books and magazines that remain unavailable online but are exceptionally helpful for local history enthusiasts. Old magazines, with their news, photos, articles, and interviews, offer a vivid depiction of past events.

In my view, I strongly believe that this is a negative development.\nTo begin with, the widespread availability of similar products worldwide can offer certain advantages, particularly to international students. When students come to a foreign country to pursue their studies, they often experience homesickness. By providing access to familiar products, we can help alleviate their homesickness. Additionally, the availability of these familiar products can make the process of adapting to a new country's lifestyle easier for students.\nOn the other hand, the global availability of similar products may undermine cultural diversity. Unique, locally-made products that are exclusive to certain regions play a significant role in showcasing the distinctiveness and fostering a sense of pride among local communities. However, when identical products are easily accessible everywhere, these distinctive items may lose their uniqueness and value. Moreover, an excessive focus on purchasing the same products can lead to a reduced interest in exploring and appreciating different cultures, ultimately resulting in a homogenization of customs and traditions. For instance, if a skilled craftsman's products from a specific region become widely available, they may no longer be considered unique and special. This situation could threaten the livelihoods of these artisans and lead to a decline in their unique art forms.\nIn conclusion, while the availability of identical products worldwide may provide convenience, I firmly believe that it carries significant negative consequences.

This is why they opt for items with established reputations, which not only promise higher quality but also offer a fashionable appeal. For instance, many Vietnamese individuals prefer buying expensive cars over cheaper, locally made ones because of limitations in the latter's design, power systems, and durability. Another compelling reason is the desire to flaunt one's possessions as a symbol of affluence and luxury. To be more specific, social media has become a phenomenon, serving as a platform for netizens to showcase their lavish lifestyles and high-income status.\nI am of the opinion that this trend brings about both individual and societal benefits. Firstly, when people refrain from spending money on low-quality products, the manufacturers of such goods will no longer be profitable. Furthermore, due to fierce competition in the market, these companies will be compelled to produce more standardized items to gain a competitive edge. Consequently, the availability of high-quality products will increase, reducing the potential risks associated with counterfeit goods. Moreover, this trend contributes to the growth of already renowned industries, setting a positive example for others to follow.

However, others contend that opting for a domestic university might be more advantageous due to the challenges that students inevitably face when living and studying in a foreign culture. In my opinion, I partially agree with this perspective.\nOn the one hand, there are compelling reasons to support the idea of studying abroad. Firstly, living independently while pursuing education in a foreign country fosters greater self-reliance. This independence arises from the need to handle everyday tasks such as cooking, managing finances, and looking after oneself. For example, students who choose to study overseas often need to take up part-time employment to cover the high tuition fees, thus honing valuable practical skills crucial for their future careers. Furthermore, studying abroad provides them with opportunities for well-paid employment, as many employers favor candidates with international qualifications. Consequently, when these graduates apply for jobs, recruiters tend to give preference to those with international degrees, thereby enhancing their career prospects.\nOn the other hand, I would argue that studying in a foreign country also carries certain disadvantages for students. Firstly, they may encounter culture shock and related issues. For instance, language barriers can hinder effective communication, making it challenging for them to express emotions and thoughts to others. Secondly, they might grapple with feelings of frustration, loneliness, and homesickness. Students who have grown up in the loving care of their parents may find it difficult to adapt to a new environment and struggle to build new relationships due to their isolation.\nIn conclusion, studying abroad brings both advantages and disadvantages for undergraduates.

From my perspective, I partially agree with this viewpoint, considering the important roles that boxing has played in our society.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that boxing may have adverse effects on human well-being. A compelling example is the case of Mike Tyson, whose boxing career brought him immense success and numerous achievements throughout his life. However, as he aged, his health deteriorated due to illnesses linked to his boxing career, such as osteoporosis and vision-related problems. Additionally, several scientists conducted research on Mike Tyson and predicted that his health would worsen with age.

In this essay, we will explore both perspectives, and I will argue that they should be mandated to work in the country where they completed their training.\nOn one hand, it is essential to respect people's right to choose where they want to reside. Forcing individuals to live in a country where they lack interest, particularly after acquiring specialized education in fields such as engineering or medicine, seems unjust. For instance, in certain developing nations, many young doctors aspire to immigrate to wealthier, developed countries to secure higher-paying positions. Their motivation and determination to excel often lead to increased efforts, ultimately enhancing their quality of life.\nOn the other hand, proponents of the view that professionals should be compelled to work in their home country argue that it can help alleviate the shortage of skilled professionals within that nation. For example, many developing countries face a shortage of physicians, and permitting them to work abroad exacerbates this problem. Moreover, numerous countries invest substantial financial resources in the education and training of their professionals, and it appears equitable for these professionals to give back to the nation that provided them with such vital education and training. For instance, India imposes mandatory service requirements on its medical professionals. Upon completing their education and training, doctors are obligated to serve in rural areas for a designated period.\nIn conclusion, while some contend that professionals should be at liberty to choose any country for their work, I firmly believe that they should be required to work in the country where they completed their training.

This situation can give rise to several issues, and this essay will propose some practical measures to address these challenges.\nOn one hand, there are compelling reasons why older individuals seeking employment are competing with their younger counterparts. Firstly, this competition impacts the unemployment rate among young people. When there is a surge in job applicants, and employment opportunities become scarcer, it becomes challenging for school leavers and young job seekers to secure stable career prospects. For instance, if both young and older candidates apply for a position at a company, the company is likely to favor older applicants who possess more market experience. Secondly, the cost of living is on the rise. Particularly, as the quality of life and living expenses increase, some individuals, even after retirement, find it necessary to continue working in order to meet their financial obligations. For example, if the elderly lack a sufficient pension or receive only a modest pension that cannot cover their basic expenses, they may be compelled to seek employment to cover essential costs like electricity, water, and housing.\nOn the other hand, there are clear solutions to mitigate these problems. Firstly, it would be prudent to consider reducing the legal retirement age. If older individuals retire from their jobs earlier, this would create more job vacancies for the younger workforce, consequently reducing the unemployment rate. Additionally, the government should offer more substantial financial benefits to older workers. Specifically, pension payments for senior citizens should be increased to ensure that individuals do not feel compelled to work beyond a certain age, such as 65, and can comfortably retire without competing with younger job seekers. For instance, the government could subsidize housing and provide support for community services to reduce the overall cost of living and expenses.\nIn conclusion, the issues stemming from older individuals competing with younger ones for employment opportunities result in increased youth unemployment and challenges in maintaining a reasonable standard of living. To address these concerns, it is essential to explore solutions such as reducing the legal retirement age and enhancing state pension benefits.\n"

This argument gains support from the idea that teenagers need to invest significant time in their education. This entails a substantial time commitment. Additionally, young individuals should broaden their horizons within their academic environment, establishing meaningful connections with peers or learning new languages. These experiences can have a profound impact on their personal growth and development. Furthermore, having an abundance of time during their educational years can lead to more quality family time. This viewpoint is reinforced by the notion that young adults should allocate sufficient time for family activities such as camping or picnicking, which can strengthen family bonds and reduce familial conflicts.\nConversely, there are compelling reasons to support the idea that children should assume responsibilities in assisting their parents with minor tasks. One rationale for this perspective is that such activities provide an excellent opportunity for children to develop discipline and attention to detail. For instance, when children engage in housecleaning, they must focus on every nook and cranny to ensure thorough cleanliness. Similarly, when they participate in work-related tasks, they must exhibit responsibility and precision in completing their duties, which can foster confidence and trust from their parents. Another justification for this viewpoint is that these responsibilities allow children to gain a deeper understanding of their parents' careers. By spending more time working alongside their parents, they can strengthen family ties and engage in meaningful conversations, ultimately enhancing their relationships with their parents.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that dedicating more time to studying and personal growth has its merits, I am inclined to believe that children assuming additional responsibilities to assist their family members holds greater significance.\n"

      "question": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of traveling with low-cost airlines?",
      "paragraph": "Many individuals argue that the most appealing aspect of traveling with low-cost airlines is the affordability factor, particularly for middle-class people. In simpler terms, opting for budget-friendly airlines allows those with relatively lower incomes and larger families to explore the world. Furthermore, low-cost airlines operate frequent and direct flights to various destinations.\nLow-cost airfare becomes even more economical when booking tickets well in advance. For example, purchasing tickets more than two weeks ahead of your travel date with a low-cost carrier like Fly-Arystan can result in approximately a 50% reduction in costs. This translates to significant savings for my family's budget.\nAnother advantage of selecting low-cost airlines is the \"Point-to-Point\" travel option. This means that even smaller aircraft can land at comparatively large airports, unlike traditional airlines that require more space and follow wider routes. Consequently, opting for low-cost carriers can save you both time and money compared to connecting flights offered by major airlines.\nHowever, aside from the availability of low-cost tickets, it's crucial to consider certain drawbacks. The primary drawback is the limited baggage allowance. A prime example of this is the additional fees for exceeding prescribed dimensions or weight limits for checked luggage. Cabin baggage, with a mass limit of less than 5 kg and adherence to airline size regulations, does not incur extra charges.\nSecondly, low-cost airlines operate smaller aircraft designed for shorter flight durations, which results in limited legroom and reduced comfort during the journey. In such cases, travelers might prefer traditional carriers.\nConsidering the aforementioned pros and cons, it's clear that many people, especially in smaller and less developed countries, are inclined to choose low-cost airlines. However, traditional carriers tend to be more expensive and may not serve certain airports. Therefore, it is generally advisable for middle-class individuals to opt for low-cost airlines, keeping in mind their budgetary constraints and travel preferences.\n"

      "question": "To what extent do you agree that businesses should highlight their product strengths in advertising?",
      "paragraph": "There is an ongoing discussion regarding the role of products in advertising. When businesses highlight their strengths, it helps customers make informed choices and promotes the availability of higher-quality items. Conversely, companies that fail to stand out may face financial difficulties. This essay explores both perspectives, ultimately advocating for the importance of highlighting product strengths in advertising.\nOn one hand, businesses can struggle when the market becomes saturated with competitors. In today's era, numerous startups offer a wide range of products to meet various consumer needs. While this provides customers with more choices, it also creates intense competition for businesses. To remain competitive, companies must showcase the advantages and benefits of their products. According to a report in The New York Times, over 90% of businesses have gone bankrupt since 2020, underscoring the significant challenges entrepreneurs face in constantly highlighting the unique features of their products.\nOn the other hand, consumers stand to benefit in terms of time, price, and quality when businesses emphasize their product strengths in advertisements. It is evident that businesses tailor their marketing to attract specific customer segments. By highlighting their product's unique qualities, they can reach their target audience and achieve success. Since individual preferences vary, companies need to emphasize how their products excel in comparison to others, making it easier for consumers to choose products that align with their needs. Furthermore, the competitive market encourages ongoing improvements in quality and materials, resulting in significant time savings for consumers.\nIn conclusion, promoting products with distinct features offers several advantages for consumers, including time and cost savings, as well as improved quality. To further support this positive development, governments should consider implementing policies that encourage and support startups.\n"

      "paragraph": "Many individuals tend to overlook environmental issues in today's world. In this essay, I wholeheartedly agree with this perspective because people primarily focus on their own lives and lack awareness about the environment.\nIt is indeed true that a significant portion of the population nowadays concentrates on their personal lives rather than showing concern for the environment. Many individuals in the modern world today prioritize their work, family, or income over environmental matters. Furthermore, with the advent of social media applications, people are increasingly engrossed in recreational activities, often neglecting their engagement with nature-related activities. For instance, a research study conducted in England revealed that over 80 percent of city residents declined to participate in environmental protection projects in favor of pursuing alternative forms of entertainment.\nMoreover, a fundamental issue lies in the fact that a vast majority of people in our society lack a precise understanding of environmental concerns. This is primarily due to their limited awareness of the pivotal role the environment plays in sustaining our lives. While the phenomenon of global warming has garnered some attention, the majority of individuals still fail to appreciate the detrimental effects it can have on the world. Regrettably, despite concerns about the consequences of environmental degradation, there is little observable change in people's behavior. For instance, even though waste bins are readily available throughout cities in Vietnam, litter is frequently discarded in inappropriate locations.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniably evident that a considerable number of people display indifference toward environmental concerns, primarily because they are preoccupied with their daily lives and lack awareness of the environment's vital importance. Despite the potentially severe consequences for the environment, I cannot dispute that this perspective is clearly reflected in our community, and I wholeheartedly concur with it.\n"

In this essay, we will explore the potential advantages and disadvantages of this trend.\nOn the positive side, there are several reasons why individuals are increasingly turning to online shopping as a viable alternative to visiting physical stores. The fast-paced nature of modern life often leaves people with limited time for their shopping needs. Consequently, the advent of online purchasing has proven to be a convenient solution for many. To illustrate, online shopping offers a user-friendly interface that allows customers to save valuable time by easily comparing prices among various online retailers. Additionally, online shopping provides customers with a wealth of useful information without the interference of in-store consultants, which can be a source of annoyance for some. Consequently, individuals have more time to dedicate to their work, ultimately enhancing their productivity in various aspects of life.\nOn the flip side, delayed deliveries can be a significant source of frustration for online shoppers who expect their purchases to arrive on the specified delivery date.

      "paragraph": "The majority of people hold the view that crime often stems from social problems and poverty, while others argue that it arises from the inherent traits of individuals. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives and provide my own opinion.\nOn one hand, there are two primary factors that contribute to the occurrence of crime, which merit our attention. Firstly, the global increase in hunger and poverty is a significant concern. For example, there are numerous homeless individuals living on the streets who are isolated from society. Consequently, they lack access to various government services and social welfare programs. Secondly, some accidents leading to criminal actions are not deliberate. For instance, a driver might attempt to cross train tracks while a train is in motion, resulting in unintended accidents.\nOn the other hand, proponents of the second viewpoint argue that crime often emerges as a consequence of an individual's innate characteristics. To begin with, criminal behavior can be influenced by a person's awareness and exposure to various stimuli. In an era of advancing technology, there is a wide range of online content, ranging from valuable to harmful. Children may imitate inappropriate conduct or even engage in criminal activities after being exposed to such content. A notable example is NTN, a well-known figure who creates toxic videos, including dangerous stunts with knives, which can have a negative impact on impressionable teenagers. Secondly, certain individuals may develop criminal tendencies due to underlying medical conditions such as neurological disorders. For many, the inability to control their thoughts and impulses can pose a danger to society.\nIn conclusion, while personal psychological factors undoubtedly play a role in the commission of crimes, I am inclined to believe that social challenges and poverty exert a significant influence on crime rates.\n"

While it may seem convincing to some that we are living in \"consumer societies\" where material possessions and ownership hold great importance, I tend to believe that \"consumer culture\" plays a crucial role in enhancing our lives.\nOn one hand, the excessive emphasis on \"consumer societies\" can have detrimental effects. Firstly, as people strive to earn and fulfill their ever-growing needs, they often find it challenging to strike a balance between work and leisure, leading to a decline in their satisfaction and potential adverse effects on their mental well-being. Secondly, a society overly focused on consumption can contribute to environmental degradation due to the excessive use of natural resources to meet individual desires. Consequently, future generations may face severe environmental problems as resources become scarce.\nOn the other hand, \"consumer culture\" undeniably benefits our lives in various ways. To begin with, it is evident that this concept can elevate people's living standards by offering improved job opportunities, job security, and the potential for career advancement in prosperous organizations like Vingroup in Vietnam, Google in the US, or Samsung in Korea. Furthermore, the positive impact of \"consumer culture\" extends to the national economy through the proliferation of companies and businesses, resulting in positive changes in the country's economic landscape. This, in turn, provides citizens with opportunities to enhance their overall quality of life.\nIn conclusion, while consumerism has its share of negative impacts on our lives, the positive effects of \"consumer culture\" cannot be denied. I firmly believe that \"consumer culture\" plays a vital role in elevating living standards and brings numerous benefits, not only to the companies we work for but also to the countries we reside in.\n"

      "question": "Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of strict and lenient parenting styles.",
      "paragraph": "Child-rearing plays a crucial role in shaping a child's inherited traits and development. There are two primary approaches to parenting: lenient and strict. Each of these parenting styles has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will outline the positive and negative aspects of both approaches.\nOn one hand, strict parenting can positively influence children in several ways. Firstly, it can foster self-discipline. Parents who employ strict discipline establish clear rules and expectations, providing their children with a structured environment. This structured environment can help children develop essential self-control skills, which are valuable in various aspects of life. Secondly, strict parents often provide a safer environment for their children. They closely monitor their children's activities, relationships, and social interactions. This high level of supervision can shield children from potential dangers and negative influences, as well as help them understand the importance of clear boundaries and the consequences of their actions.\nHowever, being raised by strict parents can also have detrimental effects on a child's development. To begin with, children subjected to strict parenting may experience a lack of autonomy. The multitude of rules imposed by strict parents can limit a child's ability to make decisions independently, potentially hindering the development of independence and creativity. Consequently, these children may struggle to develop problem-solving and decision-making skills later in life. Additionally, strict parents often suppress their children's emotional expression, which can lead to emotional repression and difficulty in identifying and managing their emotions. This emotional suppression can result in increased aggression and even physical cruelty towards others.\nOn the other hand, lenient parenting can help children gain a deeper understanding of themselves. Firstly, it can enhance their problem-solving skills. Lenient parents tend to be open-minded, fostering open communication and providing opportunities for their children to express their thoughts and ideas freely. This encourages critical thinking and logical decision-making skills, ultimately helping children become more independent problem solvers. Additionally, lenient parents prioritize their children's emotional well-being, creating a safe space for them to express and process their feelings. This nurturing environment fosters emotional intelligence, helping children understand and manage their emotions in their interactions with others.\nHowever, excessive leniency in parenting can have adverse effects. Firstly, children raised in overly permissive households may develop a sense of entitlement. When children are excessively indulged, they may come to believe that they are exempt from rules and deserve special treatment, potentially leading to entitled behavior in the future. Secondly, children of lenient parents may struggle with self-discipline and motivation. The absence of rules and the lack of emphasis on setting goals, working hard, and being competitive can impede the development of essential life skills, hindering their personal achievements in the future.\nIn conclusion, there are compelling arguments both for and against strict and lenient parenting styles. It is my belief that each approach has its own merits and drawbacks. Therefore, parents should strive to strike a balance between the two styles, creating a more effective and balanced parenting approach.\n"

      "paragraph": "Confucius once wisely stated, \"If you can choose a job you love, you will never have to work a day in your life.\" I wholeheartedly concur with this statement for the following reasons.\nFirstly, when you engage in work that truly resonates with your interests and passions, it often transcends the realm of labor, transforming into a daily pursuit of your fervor. To illustrate, imagine pursuing a career as a graphic designer, a role that has long been your aspiration. Over time, this work materializes into a genuine passion, making each workday a source of anticipation rather than drudgery. Furthermore, this profession allows you to gain recognition from a wide audience for your valuable and artistic creations.\nSecondly, pursuing a job that aligns with your passions typically yields a profound sense of fulfillment and contentment, irrespective of the job's demands or challenges. Take, for instance, the scenario where you encounter difficulties in your artistic endeavors, such as repeatedly struggling to produce a particular drawing. Instead of succumbing to discouragement, you persistently persevere, patiently honing your skills.

However, I strongly disagree with the idea that educators should completely avoid using computers in the classroom. In this essay, I will explain how technology can enhance educational efficiency and enable students to pursue distance learning courses.\nComputers should be viewed as valuable tools to support children in their studies. Laptops, for instance, have the capacity to store study materials, making it convenient for students to review lectures when necessary. This can lead to a deeper understanding of complex subjects and ultimately improve their academic performance. For instance, at my school, some students who initially struggled with grasping academic concepts experienced significant improvements in their grades after incorporating the use of Notepad, a simple program for taking notes and organizing knowledge, into their study routines.\nAnother compelling reason to embrace computers in education is their role in facilitating distance learning. There are numerous online teaching platforms accessible through computers, allowing individuals to study from anywhere they choose. This flexibility enables students to continue their education even when facing unexpected challenges or long distances from educational institutions. A prime example of this is Zoom, an application that became indispensable for educators during the COVID-19 pandemic. It allowed teachers to deliver lessons to students confined to their homes, ensuring that they remained on track with the school curriculum. In essence, neglecting these technological resources would mean missing out on valuable educational opportunities.\nIn conclusion, considering the benefits of using computers for learning and their role in making education accessible regardless of location, educators should incorporate computing devices into their teaching methods rather than excluding them.\n"

Nevertheless, I argue that a well-defined dress code can ultimately affect the quality of work by ensuring safety, supporting branding efforts, and fostering a cohesive work environment.\nTo begin with, it is crucial to establish appropriate dress codes that align with the nature of the jobs. In specific sectors like manufacturing or healthcare, strict uniform criteria may be necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of employees. For example, employees on construction sites must wear safety equipment such as goggles or helmets to prevent potential accidents. In this regard, emphasizing dress code regulations minimizes risks and enhances the overall well-being of the staff, which can directly influence productivity and work quality.\nFurthermore, having a dress code is also vital for an organization's branding. Take airlines like Emirates, for instance; they enforce a rigorous dress code for their staff, contributing to their premium and professional brand image. This consistency promotes a uniform brand identity and increases customer awareness. It also instills a sense of pride in employees who feel they are representing the brand. This pride fosters better collaboration among team members and a shared commitment to delivering outstanding service. For instance, in luxury hotels where employees are required to adhere to a strict dress code, staff members often work together cohesively to uphold the hotel's reputation for excellence, resulting in a superior guest experience.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that employers should consider dress codes in the workplace.

In this essay, I will provide several reasons for this trend and suggest measures to encourage more in-person communication.\nOne significant reason behind teenagers' preference for online socialization is the convenience it offers. Thanks to technological advancements, numerous social media platforms like Facebook and Zalo have emerged, making it effortless for people to connect regardless of their geographical locations. These platforms enable individuals to communicate freely with just a few taps on their phones. Furthermore, for introverted teenagers who may feel shy and apprehensive about in-person interactions, online communication applications serve as a comfortable avenue.

Additionally, the internet allows teenagers to forge connections with individuals from diverse backgrounds worldwide, providing opportunities to learn about foreign cultures and enhance their foreign language skills.\nTo encourage teenagers to engage in more face-to-face communication, several measures can be adopted. Firstly, educational institutions, such as schools, can organize various competitions and activities with appealing incentives, such as debates or presentations. Participation in these activities can help teenagers enhance their communication skills and boost their confidence when speaking in public. Moreover, it is crucial for family members, particularly parents, to increase their engagement with their children and maintain regular conversations. This approach allows teenagers to express themselves comfortably and feel at ease when interacting with others in person.\nIn conclusion, the preference of teenagers for online communication can be attributed to its convenience and widespread availability.

While this trend fosters closer family bonds, I argue that its effects on personal development are of greater significance.\nOn the positive side, sharing a home has several benefits, primarily strengthening the relationship between adults and their parents. Living with parents enables them to initiate face-to-face interactions and engage in intimate conversations. For example, they can seek advice on work-related matters, confide in their parents about personal issues, and even assist their parents with technological tasks. Additionally, financial savings can be another advantage for young adults living with their parents. In Vietnam, for instance, the cost of renting a house in major cities can exceed 5 million VND, which poses a significant burden, particularly for those with financial constraints.\nOn the flip side, despite these merits, I believe that this trend could lead to an extended period of immaturity among young people and hinder their path to self-sufficiency. Specifically, individuals staying in their parents' homes would be exempt from household chores, such as meal preparation, laundry, and even tidying their own rooms. Consequently, they tend to heavily depend on their parents for even the most trivial aspects of daily life, hampering their ability to become self-reliant. Moreover, in many Asian countries, overprotective behavior from helicopter parents could undermine their children's ability to assess situations and have adverse effects on their personal growth and career success.\nIn conclusion, while living with parents allows young adults to cultivate a closer relationship with them and save a significant amount of money, it can also lead to various drawbacks in their personal and professional development. Therefore, in most cases, it is advisable for adults to start living independently once they reach the age of 21 and have stable jobs.\n"

Nevertheless, I wholeheartedly support the notion that all mothers and fathers should be encouraged to partake in courses aimed at preparing them for effective parenthood.\nIn my perspective, compelling parents to enroll in parenthood preparation courses poses certain impracticalities. In today's fast-paced world, prospective parents are often engrossed in their careers, leaving them with limited time or enthusiasm for formal courses. I believe that penalizing them for missing or refusing these courses would be unjust. Furthermore, even if they consent to attend such classes, concerns may arise regarding their alignment with the teachings of these courses. Consequently, making it mandatory for all parents appears challenging.\nIn addition to the impracticalities, I hold that parenting courses are superfluous. Throughout history, parents have successfully raised their children without formal instruction or external intervention. Parenting skills have traditionally been passed down through generations and acquired through interactions with family, friends, and neighbors. More importantly, adults possess an innate capacity for effective parenting, honed through intuition, trial, and error. Many parents employ diverse strategies when dealing with a misbehaving child, gradually learning how to address behavioral issues. Hence, there is no imperative need for formal instruction.\nIn conclusion, while the idea of organizing such courses may seem appealing, I believe it lacks feasibility and purpose. Parents have historically proven their ability to nurture their offspring without mandated courses, relying on the wisdom acquired from their own upbringing and life experiences.\n"

      "paragraph": "The table provides data on the percentage of people living in poverty and the distribution of two age groups, those under 18 and those over 60, in three US states: California, Utah, and Florida. It also presents the average income per person in these states.\nOverall, several key trends emerge from the data. Firstly, Utah has the highest proportion of young people (under 18), while Florida has a significant percentage of residents aged over 60. Interestingly, despite California having the highest average income per capita among the three states, it also has the highest poverty rate compared to Utah and Florida.\nLooking at the age groups in Utah, 28% of the population consists of young people under 18, which is approximately three times higher than the percentage of senior citizens. In California, a similar pattern exists, but with a less pronounced difference. Here, 17% of the population is under 18, while 4% more are over 60. In contrast, Florida stands out with 23% of its population being over 60, which is 8% higher than the proportion of young people.\nWhen it comes to average incomes, California leads with an average income of $23,000 per person, followed by Florida with approximately $22,000. In contrast, Utah has the lowest average income, with each worker earning about $17,000. This income pattern mirrors the poverty rates in these states, with California having a 16% poverty rate, Florida with 12%, and Utah with 9%.\nIn summary, Utah has a younger population, Florida has a higher proportion of seniors, and California boasts the highest average income but also the highest poverty rate among the three states.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's world, some argue that government funds should be allocated to enhance the speed of public transportation, while others contend that there are other pressing priorities to consider, such as cost and environmental concerns. Both perspectives have their merits, but personally, I lean more towards the latter viewpoint.\nOn one hand, it cannot be denied that investing in faster public transportation offers several benefits. First and foremost, it can help address one of the most pressing challenges of our time: overurbanization. Many people migrate to urban areas in pursuit of a better quality of life. However, a major drawback is the significant time they spend commuting from their hometowns to workplaces or schools, which often leads to urban sprawl. Accelerating the speed of public transportation can alleviate this issue by reducing commute times.\nOn the other hand, there are various factors that warrant attention and improvement, such as the public transportation network, cost, and materials. The objective of enhancing these aspects is to encourage greater use of public transportation. Therefore, expanding and improving the routes and networks of buses and trains can be an effective approach to achieve this goal. Additionally, a well-developed transportation network can have a profound impact on a nation's economy. For instance, China experienced substantial economic growth after the extensive development of its road networks, which facilitated swift domestic and international goods transportation. Furthermore, individuals are more likely to choose public transportation over private vehicles if the public transport system adequately caters to their needs.\nIn conclusion, while there are clear advantages to allocating government budgets for the improvement of public transportation speed, I believe that focusing on other elements is a more practical approach. Enhancing public transportation is undoubtedly important, but it is a macroscopic endeavor, and addressing other factors can contribute significantly to the overall effectiveness of public transportation systems.\n"

      "paragraph": "The question of whether university students should diversify their studies or focus solely on their main subjects has sparked ongoing debate. Some argue in favor of dedicating all their time and attention to earning a qualification, while others believe in the value of exploring various subjects. In this essay, we will explore both perspectives before explaining why I personally favor the latter opinion.\nConcentrating solely on one subject offers certain benefits. It can help students attain a high level of expertise in that specific field while minimizing distractions. For instance, the field of medicine demands rigorous study and unwavering concentration. If a student attempts to simultaneously study medicine and business, they are likely to struggle in both areas. Additionally, focusing on a single subject can reduce the stress students face, particularly during exam periods, as they can devote more time to family and self-care when they have only one subject to prepare for.\nHowever, there are compelling reasons why learning a variety of subjects is advantageous. Pursuing multiple courses allows students to develop in diverse ways, opening up more job opportunities after graduation. This is especially relevant in the modern era, where large corporations seek employees with a broad skill set. For instance, office workers not only need qualifications in their respective fields but also must excel in information technology skills and be fluent in a second language, typically English. These skills can be acquired through university classes.\nIn conclusion, it is my belief that students should explore a range of subjects during their time at university. Furthermore, they should engage in additional activities such as charity work and the development of soft skills to expand their knowledge base. This holistic approach will ultimately enhance their prospects of securing a rewarding occupation in the future.\n"

While I agree that online friendships can be valuable to some extent, I believe that in-person friendships hold greater importance in an individual's life.\nOn one hand, online friendships offer certain advantages, but they also come with notable drawbacks that hinder the development of close bonds. Online platforms provide us with access to a diverse range of people who may appear impressive on social media, making it easy to initiate acquaintanceships. However, it is crucial to recognize that people often present only curated glimpses of their lives, showcasing fragments of their personalities and hobbies. Consequently, it becomes challenging to truly understand their authentic selves in the online realm. Furthermore, online friendships tend to be more intricate than real-life friendships due to the absence of physical and emotional proximity. For instance, when people interact online, they miss out on the ability to perceive the overall atmosphere and mood, as they would when meeting face-to-face. This limitation can lead to relationship issues and misunderstandings.\nOn the other hand, in-person friendships are simpler to solidify and nurture. Friends who meet regularly have the opportunity to develop a profound understanding of each other. This setting is particularly advantageous for those seeking friends who share their interests without reservation, fostering a deeper connection. The likelihood of finding suitable companions in real life is also higher compared to social media. Individuals can cultivate meaningful relationships that cater to their specific needs, enhancing the significance of in-person friendships in their lives.\nIn conclusion, both online and offline friendships offer unique benefits to people's lives.

Personally, I lean towards the educational aspect of museums over their entertainment value.\nIt is understandable why many people believe that museums should prioritize entertainment. Several factors support this view. First and foremost, numerous renowned brands choose museums as their showcases due to the inherent aesthetic appeal of these venues. Consequently, some individuals consider museums as the epitome of artistic expression. Additionally, museums often house a plethora of masterpieces and boast impressive architectural designs, making them an ideal backdrop for aesthetic photographs, especially for younger visitors. For instance, many exhibitions have charged an additional fee for visitors with a penchant for photography.\nDespite the various reasons in favor of museums being places of entertainment, I firmly believe that museums have a wealth of valuable educational lessons to offer. To begin with, every piece of art within a museum carries stories from its era, contributing to a deeper understanding of past lives and societies. For instance, take the \"Hoa Lo prison,\" which displays symbolic items from wartime soldiers. This museum imparts profound insights into the lives, hardships, and sacrifices of those involved in conflicts. Moreover, there are numerous abstract paintings that encourage increased creativity and observation to decipher their meanings, thereby enhancing crucial soft skills.\nIn conclusion, while the entertainment value of art centers is undeniable, the educational value they provide holds greater significance.\n"

      "paragraph": "In various regions across the globe, a significant number of children are facing issues related to obesity and poor health. It is a matter of debate whether the primary responsibility for addressing this problem lies with the government. In my view, I believe that the duty to combat this issue should be shared among governments, parents, and schools.\nUndoubtedly, governments bear a substantial responsibility for the escalating rates of childhood obesity and declining health among youngsters. This is mainly because many governments have limited or no regulations in place to control the consumption of detrimental food items like junk food and sugary beverages. Scientific research has established a clear link between these products and obesity. To illustrate, in Vietnam, the government provided tax incentives to numerous fast-food companies, which resulted in a significant increase in childhood obesity. Moreover, public spaces such as parks and squares, where children traditionally engaged in physical activities, are increasingly being replaced by high-rise apartments, shopping centers, and other urban developments. Government policies and inadequate oversight often contribute to this phenomenon.\nWhile it is undeniable that governments play a crucial role in mitigating childhood obesity, parents and schools should also share in this responsibility. Parents, in particular, have a significant impact on their children's dietary choices and physical activities. Therefore, if more parents opt for healthier food options for their children and encourage them to engage in sports and outdoor activities, we can anticipate a reduction in the number of overweight and unhealthy children. Additionally, schools can contribute by incorporating more physical education lessons into their curricula and organizing extracurricular activities that promote physical activity. This effort\n"

While this idea holds merit, I believe that, despite its benefits, it also carries several drawbacks.\nOn the positive side, it is understandable that extended study hours can yield advantages. Firstly, dedicating substantial time to studying can broaden students' knowledge, potentially leading to comprehensive development and diverse skills, consequently enhancing their career prospects. For instance, as many companies require their employees to excel in fields like languages or economics, proficiency in these areas can facilitate easier job acquisition. Secondly, a society with a strong emphasis on learning fosters greater intellect in various domains such as science and technology. This increased intellectual capacity can lead to more effective work performance, reducing unemployment rates, and bolstering corporate profitability.\nConversely, there are compelling reasons why extensive study both in and after school can have disadvantages. Initially, if students spend the majority of their day studying, they will have limited personal time, potentially challenging their ability to manage their time effectively. For instance, excessive studying may leave little time for physical exercise, leading to fatigue and exhaustion, which can negatively impact not only their physical but also their psychological well-being. Another point worth considering is that, while excessive theoretical study can impart broad knowledge, it may cause students to overlook essential practical skills like communication. Consequently, they might face difficulties at work, including strained relationships with colleagues and reduced productivity, which can have detrimental effects on both their companies and society as a whole.\nIn conclusion, despite the aforementioned benefits of encouraging children to study extensively both in and after school, I believe that the drawbacks can outweigh these advantages due to the adverse consequences for not only students' health but also society's overall productivity.\n"

      "paragraph": "Success in sports is influenced by various factors, and physical ability is often considered a crucial element. However, some argue that other factors like luck and hard work are equally essential for achieving success in sports. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives.\nOn one hand, physical ability undoubtedly plays a significant role in winning sports competitions. Being strong and healthy is a fundamental requirement for identifying talented athletes, particularly those who aspire to participate in international sporting events. Furthermore, many aspects of sports demand that athletes maintain excellent physical condition to face the challenges posed by their respective disciplines. It is rare for athletes to achieve success without a solid foundation of physical ability from an early age. For instance, consider swimming, a sport that requires athletes to possess a natural talent for breathing and strong leg muscles to cover long distances in a short time. Michael Phelps, blessed with innate swimming prowess, stands out as one of the world's most accomplished athletes.\nOn the other hand, an athlete's success in sports is not solely determined by physical prowess. Even if an athlete starts with good physical health, neglecting regular exercise can lead to a decline in their physical abilities over time. In addition to hard work, luck also plays a crucial role in achieving victory. Unexpected situations can arise during competitions, which participants cannot anticipate when they enter an event like the Olympics. Adverse circumstances can disrupt an athlete's performance, making it essential to maintain strong mental health. Confidence is a key factor in unleashing an athlete's full potential.\nIn conclusion, both physical ability and other factors such as hard work, luck, and mental health are vital for success in sports.

From my perspective, emphasizing studying proves more advantageous for young individuals.\nFirstly, studying stands as the primary activity for all students, serving as the cornerstone for children to enhance their knowledge and develop skills across all domains. It also equips them for tests and examinations. For example, studying holds paramount importance for Vietnamese twelfth-grade students, who, after twelve years of learning, must partake in the national high school examination. This evaluation encompasses all Vietnamese high school students and significantly influences their prospects of attending their preferred university.\nSecondly, parents can encourage their children to participate in physical activities during their leisure hours for recreational purposes following their study time. Certain sports can help them unwind and rejuvenate. Take my friend Tai as an example. He excels academically at my university, attending numerous classes six days a week. Nevertheless, he dedicates time to playing badminton every Sunday, affording him the opportunity to socialize with friends and strike a balance between academic commitments and physical activities.\nIn conclusion, it is paramount for young individuals to prioritize learning over physical activities.

I agree that this should be seen as a positive trend due to the greater variety and improved quality of products they offer.\nOne of the main advantages is the extensive range of products available in larger shopping malls and supermarkets. Customers not only have access to a wider variety of products but can also compare different brands before making a purchase that best suits their needs. This level of satisfaction is challenging to attain when shopping in smaller stores. Additionally, these large complexes often offer various services and activities, such as children's playgrounds, virtual reality games, or movie theaters. As a result, customers' shopping experiences are greatly enhanced, leading to more frequent return visits.\nFurthermore, the quality of products in supermarkets and shopping malls is reliable and superior to those in traditional outlets. This is because these large stores collaborate with suppliers who can provide high-quality goods at reasonable prices. Consequently, manufacturers are compelled to continually innovate their production processes and enhance the quality of their products to compete effectively and attract more customers. Consequently, customers benefit from an improved shopping experience.\nIn conclusion, as customers are presented with a wide variety of reasonably priced, high-quality products, I believe the prevalence of supermarkets should be considered a positive development.\n"

      "paragraph": "Homelessness has been a persistent issue, especially in major cities worldwide in recent years. This essay aims to elucidate the primary causes of this problem and propose potential solutions.\nFirst and foremost, the escalating cost of housing in urban areas, driven by high population density, is a significant contributor to homelessness. Many low-income workers find it challenging to afford accommodation due to these soaring costs. Even though cities witness a continuous construction boom, a substantial portion of the population still struggles to secure shelter. For instance, consider New York City, renowned for its exorbitant housing prices. Despite successfully competing for employment opportunities, a group of homeless individuals can be observed sleeping in parks.\nMoreover, rural residents are increasingly enticed to relocate to major cities with the hope of improving their lives. Undoubtedly, urban environments offer greater prospects and a wider array of recreational activities. However, they come hand in hand with a highly competitive job market that demands high academic qualifications and exceptional resumes.\nSeveral measures can be adopted to alleviate these challenges. Firstly, governments could provide subsidies to employers offering low wages, enabling them to offer temporary housing with essential amenities to their employees. This support would not only enhance the well-being of workers but also empower them to eventually purchase their own homes.\nFurthermore, encouraging large companies and industries to establish operations in suburban areas could help distribute job opportunities more evenly. This dispersion of economic activities would contribute to an overall increase in employment rates and make housing more accessible for residents.\nIn conclusion, homelessness is a complex issue stemming from a combination of factors. It is crucial for authorities to shoulder the primary responsibility for addressing this situation. By implementing the proposed measures, we can work towards mitigating the problem of homelessness in our cities.\n"

While this viewpoint holds some validity, I strongly disagree with it for the following reasons.\nTo begin with, it is conceivable to argue that certain celebrities are renowned without substantial achievements in their careers. From a personal perspective, these individuals may have inherited substantial wealth from their parents or possess striking physical appearances. The primary reason they gain notoriety is often their penchant for flaunting luxurious possessions such as bags, clothing, and jewelry. The influential connections of their family members, as well as associations with other famous personalities who have achieved a degree of fame, may also significantly contribute to their reputation. For example, Paris Hilton, known for her extravagant lifestyle, inherited a vast fortune from the Hilton hotel chain established by her great-grandfather Conrad Hilton in the early 20th century. Consequently, her fame can be considered justified.\nHowever, despite the aforementioned argument, I would argue that there are still numerous talented celebrities who make positive contributions to our society.

Indeed, celebrities possess significant influence over everyone, particularly the younger generation. The youth, being less mature and decisive, might find it challenging to distinguish between right and wrong influences, often easily following trends or individuals who can enhance their excitement and happiness. Consequently, many unethical idols who set bad examples can inadvertently impart negative and misleading information that can negatively impact adolescents. Moreover, young people often emulate the actions of the stars they admire, regardless of whether these stars are good role models or not. This can have detrimental effects not only on the youth's careers but also on their personal lives. For instance, a football star, famous for his goal-scoring prowess and wealth, might also struggle with alcoholism in his daily life. His numerous fans might accept this behavior because of his fame and believe he has the right to engage in such actions. However, young and curious individuals may imitate him by consuming the same alcoholic beverages.\nOn the other hand, there are cases where media and sports idols, who may have been poor role models in the past, have transformed into better individuals. These are individuals who were originally good people but made mistakes earlier in their careers. Nevertheless, they have since turned over a new leaf, becoming successful and capturing the attention of many, particularly through social media in the modern world.

After carefully evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of this proposal, I find myself leaning towards the benefits that outweigh the drawbacks for several reasons outlined in this essay.\nOn the positive side, learning how to grow vegetables and nurture animals would significantly contribute to primary students' connection with the natural environment. In simpler terms, children would have a wonderful opportunity to embrace farming and biological knowledge through these activities. For instance, when students visit an organic farm, they can interact with adorable animals like rabbits, camels, goats, and cows and witness the complete process of cultivating tomatoes and potatoes, from planting seeds and irrigating to watering. Gaining firsthand knowledge of the natural life cycle gradually instills a love for plants and animals in them, enhancing their awareness of environmental conservation during their formative years. Another substantial advantage is the reduction of children's screen time, coupled with the promotion of their physical and mental well-being. Instead of spending their leisure time on computer games or social media, exposing them to nature is likely to expand their natural intelligence and foster physical growth.\nOn the flip side, it is true that young students are susceptible to injuries and accidents at their age. Without constant supervision and safety precautions from adults, there is a possibility that either animals or sharp gardening tools could pose risks to them. To illustrate, my cousin once sustained an injury from a small shovel while growing carrots with his class because his teacher was focused on another task. This incident underscores the importance of continuous supervision and thorough training to ensure the safety of primary school children during such activities.\nIn summary, despite some potential risks and dangers associated with tending to plants and animals, I firmly believe that the benefits outweigh them for the sake of primary school children's understanding of nature and engagement in outdoor activities.\n"

      "question": "Should primary school children learn practical skills such as cultivating vegetables and caring for animals, despite the potential risks?",
      "paragraph": "Regarding various viewpoints, many people suggest that primary school children should acquire practical skills like cultivating vegetables and caring for animals. After evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of this idea, I am inclined to believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks for several reasons presented in this essay.\nOn the positive side, learning how to cultivate vegetables and care for animals would play a crucial role in connecting primary students with the natural environment. In other words, children have an excellent opportunity to engage in farming and biological knowledge through these activities. For instance, consider extracurricular activities in primary schools that lead students to organic farms, where they can interact with charming animals such as rabbits, camels, goats, and cows, and witness the entire process of growing vegetables, including planting, irrigation, and watering. Through these experiences, their love for flora and fauna gradually develops, leading to an increased awareness of environmental conservation during their formative years. Another significant advantage is the reduction of children's screen time and the promotion of their physical and mental well-being. Instead of spending their leisure time playing computer games or using social networking platforms, exposure to nature is likely to enhance their natural intelligence and physical growth.\nOn the flip side, it is undeniable that at this age, students are vulnerable to injuries and accidents. Without constant supervision and safety measures from adults, both animals and sharp tools associated with gardening could potentially harm them. To illustrate, my cousin once got injured by a small shovel while growing carrots with his class because his teacher was focused on another student. Therefore, in order to ensure their safety, it is essential to have a sufficient number of supervisors and provide thorough training to equip each student before engaging in these activities.\nIn conclusion, despite the potential risks and dangers associated with nurturing plants and animals, I firmly believe that the advantages outweigh them for the sake of primary school children's understanding of nature and their engagement in outdoor activities.\n"

      "question": "Why do local people tend to visit museums and historical sites less than tourists? What can be done to encourage them to visit more often?",
      "paragraph": "It is true that most historical sites and museums are mainly visited by tourists, while local people tend to engage in limited sightseeing. In my opinion, there are several reasons behind this trend. This essay will discuss some of these reasons and propose potential solutions.\nTo begin with, one key factor is the perception that visiting museums or historical sites is boring for local residents. Specifically, the majority of local citizens are already familiar with their surroundings, including places, cuisine, and recreational activities. Consequently, they often view such visits as a waste of time and uninteresting. In contrast, tourists are typically excited and curious about new experiences in their destinations. They genuinely desire to explore museums and historical sites to gain insights into the history, culture, and people, as well as to capture memories through photographs.\nAnother contributing factor is the high cost of admission tickets to these places, which local residents may find unaffordable.\nNevertheless, various measures can be adopted to address this situation. Firstly, the government could organize cultural and traditional programs at museums or historical sites to attract local residents and tourists alike. These programs could provide opportunities for the local community to engage in enriching experiences.\nSecondly, schools and other organizations could create conditions that encourage students and local residents to visit these sites. Offering discounts or free admission to locals could be an effective incentive to promote visits. Moreover, increasing job opportunities within the tourism industry for the local population, both in domestic and international tourism, could help strengthen their connection to these historical places.\nIn conclusion, attracting local people to visit museums and historical sites in their area may be a complex process. However, there are several ways that locals could be encouraged to do so.\n"

      "paragraph": "Opinions are divided on whether schools should tailor their teaching methods to match students' academic abilities or if it's better to have students with varying abilities studying together. This essay will explore the rationale behind the former perspective, but I firmly support the latter.\nThose who advocate for schools to teach students according to their academic abilities put forth several arguments. They contend that teachers can more effectively impart knowledge to students who can quickly grasp and retain lessons. For instance, in a math class where all students exhibit a high IQ and strong logical reasoning, teachers can save time during instruction and employ the most efficient teaching methods. Another plausible argument is that students can cultivate their strengths and abilities in their favorite subjects. To illustrate, when students study their preferred subjects, they generate numerous novel and creative ideas. This fosters confidence and creativity, which can contribute positively to their societal development.\nHowever, I maintain my belief in the value of allowing students with diverse abilities to study together. Primarily, this approach provides numerous opportunities for collaborative development. In a mixed-ability class, students can learn from each other. Those proficient in mathematics can assist those excelling in literature, and vice versa. Consequently, everyone can benefit from collective learning and personal growth. Another compelling reason is that, through simple interactions, students can forge friendships across various domains of expertise. This not only aids in academic support but also facilitates the acquisition of diverse skills.\nIn conclusion, it is understandable why some argue in favor of schools focusing on tailoring teaching methods to match students' abilities and interests. However, in my opinion, integrating students based on their varied academic strengths is more advantageous for both educators and learners.\n"

This essay will explore the underlying causes of this issue and then propose some practical solutions.\nThere are several factors contributing to why the majority of people struggle to attain equilibrium between their work and personal lives. Foremost among these is the necessity to work diligently to meet their living expenses, cover daily needs, and support their families. Consequently, they find themselves working tirelessly each day to earn a livelihood. To elaborate, in the contemporary job market, there is intense competition, and people aspire to lead a comfortable life. As a result, they often engage in overtime work to fulfill their dreams and desires, which leaves them with little time for themselves and their families. Another significant factor is the pervasive influence of technology. For instance, numerous websites and mobile applications captivate individuals, and in their free time, instead of investing in self-care or social interactions, people often waste time on social networking platforms, observing the lives of others.\nNevertheless, there are various measures that can be taken to address this situation. One possible approach is for individuals to prioritize job stability and select roles that align with their interests and needs. By doing so, they can strike a better balance between their professional commitments and personal life. Another solution is to allocate time for self-care during their leisure hours. For example, after a long day of hard work, individuals should prioritize rest and physical rejuvenation. They can set aside work-related matters and limit their use of social media to focus on self-care and recharging.\nIn conclusion, there are several reasons why people find it challenging to balance their work and personal lives in today's society. However, steps can be taken to alleviate this situation, such as choosing suitable jobs and dedicating time to self-care during leisure hours.\n"

      "paragraph": "There have been recent calls for the introduction of a new language to facilitate global communication. In my view, while this could promote economic fairness, it is not a practical solution.\nProponents of an international language highlight its economic benefits. The primary argument is that it would eliminate existing barriers to success. Currently, English serves as a near-universal language, granting individuals born in English-speaking countries a significant advantage. In contrast, those from non-English-speaking nations, who cannot afford private language instruction, start life at a disadvantage. A new language could potentially level the playing field. Additionally, reducing the dominance of English could enable developing countries to engage more deeply with the global market, expanding their reach in offering services, entertainment, and products to a broader audience.\nHowever, the disadvantages of this proposal revolve around its practicality. In an ideal world, having a global language would be beneficial, but the investment of time and resources required is substantial. The best evidence of this can be seen in the progress of the current dominant global language, English. Countries worldwide allocate significant resources to English education, yet the majority of the global population still struggles to achieve fluency. Introducing a new language would be even more challenging, not only due to the universal adoption needed but also because there would be limited incentive when people can already communicate with their fellow citizens and English enables communication with a substantial portion of the global population. The financial and time commitments required for such a transition are immense, impractical, and could have negative consequences for both individuals and society.\nIn conclusion, the drawbacks of implementing an international language far outweigh any potential benefits. Instead, countries should continue to invest in English education in the hopes of establishing it as the global lingua franca.\n"

      "paragraph": "In recent times, environmental protection has become one of the most pressing global concerns in both developed and developing countries. Many agree that the higher the production of consumer goods, the more damage is inflicted on the natural environment. In this essay, I will identify the causes and offer my perspective on how to address this issue.\nThe growth in consumer demand leads to environmental damage due to several factors. While it is true that increased production leads to more waste being discarded in the streets, we must consider the broader picture. Specifically, the rise in consumerism can result in soil erosion due to the higher use of chemical substances, including pesticides and herbicides, employed to stimulate crop growth. Secondly, lax regulations in some countries allow more industries to emit toxic gases into the atmosphere and release pollutants into rivers and beaches. These actions contribute not only to air pollution but also to water pollution.\nTherefore, I suggest some solutions to prevent these hazardous circumstances. Firstly, it is essential to raise awareness among the public to discourage negative behaviors like littering on the streets. Instead of wearing clothes just once and then discarding them in landfills, individuals can accumulate and support impoverished people. Secondly, governments should encourage citizens and businesses to use and produce recycled items. For example, some businesses, such as those producing Milo milk, have started using eco-friendly straws made of paper and bamboo. Finally, governments should also enforce strict laws and regulations to penalize companies that release untreated wastewater into the environment, ensuring that marine creatures are not harmed on the beaches.\nIn conclusion, consumerism has led retailers and businesses to engage in harmful practices for the natural environment. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals to raise awareness, and governments should promote the use of recycled items among citizens and businesses alike.\n"

      "paragraph": "It is true that aging is becoming a common feature in recent times. Although there are some benefits to people living longer for society, I would argue that there are far more drawbacks.\nOne of the main advantages of the trend towards an aging population is that it provides more opportunities for individuals to fulfill their admirable dreams. In life, some people may not have had the chance to achieve their aspirations when they were young due to various reasons, such as a lack of money, time, ambition, fear of failure, or the need for a healthy and balanced life like everyone else. Therefore, when elderly people retire from work, they want to complete what they could not do in their youth. Living longer creates the opportunity for them to do this.\nDespite the positives mentioned above, I believe that an aging population is a negative development for various reasons. Firstly, the older people become, the more their bodies tend to suffer from health issues. Instead of a long life giving elderly people opportunities to do what they want, their health may not allow them to do so. Secondly, an aging population creates economic burdens for younger generations who have to pay taxes to support policies designed for the elderly. This puts a strain on the weaker members of society. Finally, as the number of elderly people increases, the government must allocate funds for amenities and accommodations for them, such as nursing homes. An aging population not only places a burden on the government but also on young people who must bear the brunt of these extremely high taxes.\nIn conclusion, while I recognize the potential advantages of an aging population, I consider it to be a negative development overall.\n"

While some argue that this trend benefits the world of sports, others raise concerns about such sponsorship. This essay will examine both perspectives, and I will explain why I lean towards the former.\nOn one hand, people express concerns about the negative influence of advertising in sports. They argue that the extensive promotion of various products during sporting events can have adverse effects on people's health. For instance, during the 2020 Japanese Olympics, KFC sponsored football tournaments and introduced a new menu, including items like fries and burgers. When children saw athletes consuming this food, they might develop the mistaken impression that such fare is wholesome. This can contribute to an increase in childhood obesity rates. Additionally, the prevalence of advertising in sports can disrupt an individual's viewing experience, with numerous TV ads repeating frequently and interrupting live broadcasts. As a result, viewership numbers may decline.\nOn the other hand, it is widely recognized that the benefits of sponsoring sports events outweigh the potential drawbacks mentioned above. Firstly, funds from companies can be used to acquire new facilities and compensate event staff. Furthermore, for businesses, sponsoring sports provides an excellent opportunity to boost the sales of their products. By advertising during sports events, companies can increase their revenue, enabling them to innovate their products and services while expanding their operations, thereby creating more job opportunities for the public. Consequently, it becomes advantageous for everyone involved.\nIn conclusion, while sports sponsorships may sometimes promote unhealthy food choices or disrupt the viewing experience, I firmly believe that they can make a significant contribution to the advancement of sports and businesses alike.\n"

I completely agree that reading can greatly enhance a person's imagination. However, I also believe that reading and watching television can be equally valuable as tools for improving language skills.\nIt is clear that reading is a more efficient method for boosting imagination. Books, in particular, often lack illustrations and pictures, requiring readers to use their creativity to visualize the described objects. In contrast, movies provide audiences with vivid images, dynamic movements, and special effects, which can limit imagination to some extent. Take, for example, Disney's live-action adaptation of \"The Little Mermaid,\" where the actress playing Ariel differs from the original animated character. This deviation from the expected image of the mermaid led to harsh criticism of the movie and the actress. This illustrates how movies can discourage people from thinking differently and exploring multiple perspectives. Furthermore, reading allows readers to pause, delve deeper into the content, and revisit interesting parts for better comprehension.\nRegarding the potential to enhance language skills, I believe that both reading and watching TV play important but distinct roles. When individuals read books, they not only acquire essential grammar skills and expand their vocabulary but also learn how to apply this knowledge to academic writing. Moreover, the more they read, the faster their reading speed becomes, thereby improving their reading skills. Simultaneously, watching movies can enhance listening skills, especially when it comes to uncommon slang and foreign languages. Through the dialogues among film characters, people can pick up several useful communication tips and improve their ability to engage in effective conversations in real life.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that we should prioritize reading books to broaden our minds rather than watching television. However, it's essential to recognize that both reading materials and films can contribute to strengthening various language-related skills, including reading, writing, listening, and communication.\n"

Some argue that the responsibility for this lies primarily with governments and politicians, rather than individuals, as individuals may not have the capacity to address these challenges effectively. In my view, safeguarding the environment is a shared responsibility, but I believe that governments are better equipped to make a substantial impact compared to individual citizens.\nIt is undeniable that governments possess the authority to enact laws and policies related to environmental protection that can influence millions of individuals. Moreover, governments have access to various resources that enable them to undertake initiatives such as establishing and operating recycling facilities for everyday waste. They can also promote awareness about environmental conservation through internet and television campaigns, which can reach a national or even international audience.\nOn the other hand, I acknowledge that there are certain limitations when it comes to individuals' ability to drive large-scale environmental initiatives. It is challenging to mobilize a significant number of individuals to advocate for environmental protection laws. Nevertheless, individuals can make valuable contributions by altering their consumption patterns. This includes conserving resources, reusing products multiple times, and opting for public transportation over private vehicles.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that politicians play a crucial role in environmental protection.

      "paragraph": "It is widely acknowledged that smoking poses a significant threat to the physical well-being of both the smoker and those in close proximity. Therefore, the idea of prohibiting smoking in public places is strongly endorsed. I wholeheartedly support this viewpoint.\nThere are several compelling reasons behind the prohibition of smoking in public spaces. To begin with, smoking is linked to a range of long-term health complications, including high blood pressure, stroke, and heart attacks. While these health issues may not manifest immediately, frequent exposure to cigarette smoke can lead to deteriorating health over time. Moreover, it is important to recognize that not only smokers but also non-smokers are adversely affected by secondhand smoke. This is especially unfair to vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women, and individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, as constant exposure to smoke can weaken their health. Therefore, imposing a ban serves as a safeguard for the health and well-being of all individuals.\nIn my view, smoking not only harms our bodies but also poses a threat to the environment. Residues from cigarette smoke have the potential to ignite fires accidentally, leading to harm to both people and property. Countless instances of fires caused by seemingly minor sparks from cigarettes have been reported in the media. Hence, it is imperative to restrict smoking not only in public places but also within private residences.\nFinally, for individuals struggling to quit smoking, there are viable solutions to reduce tobacco smoke exposure. This includes the provision of designated smoking areas and the utilization of nicotine replacement therapy. By adopting these measures, smokers can refrain from using tobacco in public areas, thereby reducing the impact on non-smokers. I firmly believe that this approach offers a practical means of keeping a safe distance between smokers and non-smokers.\nIn conclusion, the implementation of a ban on smoking in public places is highly recommended in order to safeguard the health of all individuals.\n"

Some argue that implementing car-free days is a worthwhile solution, while others believe there are more viable alternatives. This essay aims to present both perspectives before expressing my own viewpoint.\nOn one hand, proponents of car-free days argue that this approach can significantly reduce emissions from transportation, particularly the pollution generated by individual cars. Vehicle emissions, including the release of carbon dioxide during the combustion of car fuels, are a leading cause of deteriorating air quality. By implementing car-free days, it becomes possible to curtail these harmful emissions and improve the overall air quality. It is worth noting that during lockdowns, public transportation often becomes a popular choice, especially in countries with large populations and less developed public transportation systems. This shift to public transport can alleviate traffic congestion, another major contributor to air pollution.\nOn the other hand, an equally compelling argument comes from those who advocate for more practical methods. For instance, several European Union countries have effectively reduced air pollution by implementing carbon dioxide emission taxes on personal car owners. The combination of high fossil fuel costs and emission taxes places a financial burden on individuals, encouraging them to opt for public transportation instead. The revenue generated from these emission taxes can then be reinvested in improving public transportation infrastructure, further reducing air pollution stemming from traffic congestion.\nIn conclusion, while both of these viewpoints have their merits, I am more inclined to believe that there are numerous other comprehensive solutions available to combat air pollution.\n"

Some individuals believe that universities offering online courses provide students with an alternative to attending classes on campus. In this essay, I will discuss both the positive and negative aspects of this development.\nOn one hand, there are several reasons why some people view online courses as having a negative impact on students. Firstly, it can affect students' abilities in school. Nowadays, technology has become very popular, and many families have two or three devices that their children can use for entertainment or learning without any time restrictions. For instance, they may have a computer and a phone. They simply turn on the computer, join the online class, and passively listen to the teacher without taking notes. As a result, they may not pay proper attention to the lesson, which can lead to lower grades in the future and a loss of trust from their parents. Secondly, online courses can lead to challenges. If a student doesn't have internet access on a particular day, they will miss the class and find it difficult to catch up later. Similarly, teachers may struggle to ensure that all students understand the material as effectively as they would in a traditional classroom setting.\nOn the other hand, there are positive aspects to online courses. Firstly, they offer convenience to both students and teachers. They save valuable time that would otherwise be spent commuting to and from school. Instead, students can simply turn on their phones and connect to their classes. This is particularly important for students who are concerned about their appearance and prefer to wear comfortable clothing while learning. For example, in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, citizens often face traffic-related challenges. Therefore, online courses provide a solution that allows students to avoid worrying about such issues.\nIn conclusion, while some people believe that online courses have negative effects, there are also valid reasons to consider them as a positive development.

In my view, dedicating oneself primarily to the major is essential.\nOn one hand, contemporary undergraduates aspire to acquire a well-rounded education to maximize their potential. Universities typically provide a wider range of subjects compared to high school curricula, encompassing various facets of society. Consequently, some students enter university believing that studying multiple subjects will better prepare them for future career challenges. In today's competitive job market, possessing knowledge in a minor field or a multidisciplinary skill set can enhance employment prospects and adaptability.\nHowever, students must carefully consider whether to allocate their time and energy to a multitude of subjects or concentrate on their major courses. Freshers may assume they have ample time to explore diverse topics, given that first-year programs often include more general subjects than specialized ones. Nevertheless, delving into a specialized field of study demands significant dedication to comprehend its intricate content fully. If students divert their attention away from their major to unrelated subjects, they risk not acquiring the in-depth knowledge necessary for obtaining a qualification, which could hinder their academic progress. In some instances, attempting to learn too many subjects concurrently can lead to delayed graduation due to improper time management, resulting in lower academic performance or even exam failure.\nIn conclusion, while continuous learning is undoubtedly beneficial for students, I firmly believe that their primary focus should always be on their major subjects.

Firstly, maintaining a sense of equality and comfort among employees is important. Clothing that accentuates economic disparities should be discouraged by managers or supervisors to ensure that employees do not feel disadvantaged. Dressing uniformly can promote a more harmonious work environment. Secondly, adhering to a professional dress code can enhance a company's image of competence and reliability in the eyes of clients and customers. The use of company uniforms plays a crucial role in creating a professional and trustworthy impression. Without this, a company may struggle to establish a positive reputation among its clients.\nOn the other hand, allowing employees to choose their attire has its merits. Firstly, many argue that what truly matters in a professional setting is an employee's ability to perform their job effectively. Allowing employees to select their clothing enables them to concentrate fully on their work, which can lead to improved job performance and overall productivity. Secondly, respecting the diverse religious and cultural requirements of employees is of utmost importance. Therefore, permitting employees to wear attire that aligns with their beliefs is essential.

However, there are others who argue that certain information holds too much value and importance to be freely disclosed. I partially agree with the latter viewpoint more than the former.\nIt is widely acknowledged that to advance in any specific field, individuals within that community should be willing to collaborate and assist others. For instance, in recent years, Vietnam has grappled with the nightmarish impact of Covid-19 due to its highly contagious nature. Scientists from various backgrounds had to collaborate and exchange vast amounts of data regarding the virus. Several years later, a vaccine called Astra was developed and distributed free of charge to the population. Concurrently, information about Covid-19 was disseminated among residents to educate them on how to prevent its spread. This example demonstrates the significant benefits of sharing vital knowledge, not only in the medical field but also in business. Many established restaurants, for instance, generously share their recipes online to aid aspiring restaurateurs or home cooks in preparing delicious meals for their families. Sharing information, both online and offline, can profoundly enhance society, and most people would consider this a commendable practice.\nOn the flip side, not all information can be freely shared with unknown individuals.

I strongly disagree with the notion that these sports are excessively perilous and, consequently, advocate against their prohibition.\nIn my perspective, so-called extreme sports are not as hazardous as many individuals perceive them to be. All sports inherently entail some degree of risk, and it is imperative to have well-defined regulations and safety protocols in place to minimize the likelihood of accidents. Participants in extreme sports typically undergo comprehensive training to mitigate potential dangers. For instance, individuals aspiring to experience skydiving must enroll in lessons offered by a certified club, and novice jumpers are not permitted to go solo; they must be accompanied by a seasoned professional. Furthermore, the protective gear and technology employed in sports ranging from motor racing to mountain climbing are continually advancing, enhancing overall safety.\nWhile I advocate for regulations and safety measures, I firmly believe that banning extreme sports would be both unjust and nearly unfeasible. Primarily, individuals should have the autonomy to determine how they utilize their leisure time; as long as they comprehend the associated risks, I do not think it is within the purview of politicians to curtail such activities. Nevertheless, a more compelling argument against implementing a ban lies in the difficulty of enforcing it. Many of the riskiest sports, such as base jumping or big wave surfing, are practiced in remote locations far from the reach of authorities. Envisioning law enforcement intervening to prevent people from parachuting off a mountainside or surfing on an isolated beach seems implausible.\nIn conclusion, I contend that people should retain the freedom to indulge in extreme sports, provided they possess an understanding of the potential risks and take appropriate precautions.\n"

Firstly, the presence of skilled professionals such as electricians and plumbers is indispensable in the construction and maintenance of buildings. For instance, essential facilities like hospitals and schools require regular renovation and upkeep. Employing well-trained workers for these tasks not only ensures the safety and longevity of these structures but also enhances the overall quality of life within the community. Moreover, it is evident that some countries are currently witnessing an oversaturation of academic graduates in specific majors, leading to a steep rise in graduate unemployment rates each year.

As a result, students who graduate from such programs are better positioned to secure promising positions in multinational corporations. This trend has gained traction worldwide, benefiting professionals and students from all walks of life by facilitating their career advancement.\nIn conclusion, I firmly support the idea that encouraging more individuals to pursue vocational training is essential.

One of the primary concerns is the risk of losing academic knowledge during the gap year. As they take a break from formal education, the information they acquired in high school may start to fade, potentially causing them to fall behind their peers and society in general once they enter university. Additionally, there is the possibility that students who opt for a gap year may face challenges in securing employment. This is because their additional year away from academic studies may not significantly enhance their qualifications, potentially resulting in less impressive CVs and reduced job prospects.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that the concept of taking a gap year between high school and university studies has both advantages and disadvantages. The decision to pursue this path should be made carefully, taking into account the individual's circumstances and goals.\n"

      "question": "Should extreme sports like skydiving and skiing be banned?",
      "paragraph": "Extreme sports are indeed a two-sided coin. While they can provide numerous unforgettable experiences and a sense of accomplishment, they also have drawbacks that can create tension among different communities. I partially disagree with the notion that skydiving and skiing should be banned.\nOn one hand, there are several reasons why individuals are keen to try extreme sports. Firstly, they enjoy challenging activities like skydiving and skiing because they offer a sense of accomplishment and pride. For example, some people are fearless when it comes to heights, and they become enthusiastic about leaping from the sky or conquering steep slopes. Others believe that the thrill lies in the danger itself. Moreover, these activities push individuals to step out of their comfort zones. If a task is too easy, it can feel meaningless, so extreme sports become an appealing choice.\nOn the other hand, extreme sports also carry inherent risks. Firstly, the likelihood of a fatal accident is significantly higher in these activities. While service providers strive to offer safe facilities and guarantees, they cannot control all the variables in sports like skydiving and skiing. For instance, in the United States, there have been incidents with roller coasters, one of the extreme games, resulting in the loss of many lives due to organizers' inability to ensure complete safety. Additionally, these sports can pose health hazards such as heart conditions and stress. Engaging in such activities can be emotionally taxing, as individuals often experience intense fear. For instance, after riding high-speed roller coasters and facing other challenges, individuals may find themselves in tears or obsessed with speed, significantly affecting their mental well-being.\nIn conclusion, I contend that people should have the freedom to enjoy extreme sports as long as they are aware of the risks and take appropriate precautions.\n"

      "paragraph": "In regards to various viewpoints, there is a widespread belief that if governments promote international tourism, it can bring substantial benefits, especially in the local socio-economic context. However, concerns related to environmental issues and the impact on local communities also hold significant attention. After carefully considering both sides, I am inclined to believe that the negative aspects outweigh the positive ones, as I will discuss in this essay.\nOn the positive side, welcoming foreign tourists can contribute to the overall economic growth of a nation. In other words, when they visit local tourist destinations, they incur various travel expenses such as airfare, accommodation, food, and admission tickets. This results in increased revenue for local businesses. For instance, Thailand, known for its exceptional service and friendly population, has emerged as a popular destination in Asia. By prioritizing and promoting tourism, Thailand has experienced a significant boost in its national GDP. Another notable benefit is the enhancement of a country's global reputation. This means that not only beautiful local attractions and historical sites but also unique customs and delicious cuisines become well-known internationally through the positive feedback and impressions shared by tourists. For example, Ninh Binh province in Vietnam gained recognition as a world wonder due to numerous visits and recommendations.\nOn the flip side, this trend has several adverse effects on wildlife and natural habitats. By this, I mean that to support tourism, numerous resorts, amusement parks, restaurants, and other facilities are constructed, resulting in the removal of various trees that used to provide shelter to animals. Additionally, there is the issue of water and land pollution caused by tourist waste and carbon emissions. Da Lat City serves as an example where the extensive felling of pine trees to make way for greenhouse farming, homestays, coffee shops, and tourist areas has led to severe floods, air pollution, and higher temperatures, causing significant problems for the local population. Consequently, ecotourism is being viewed as a more sustainable alternative, as it aims to combine tourism with ecosystem preservation.\nTo conclude, despite the notable advantages of international tourism, it is crucial to strike a balance between promoting foreign tourism and conserving the environment, particularly by minimizing disruption to wildlife and maintaining natural resources. Failure to do so may result in more frequent and severe disasters that not only damage properties but also endanger human lives.\n"

      "paragraph": "\"Some individuals argue that there are numerous advantages to participating in team sports like football. Meanwhile, others prefer individual sports such as tennis or swimming. In my personal opinion, both perspectives offer common benefits, such as improving overall physical fitness and reducing stress, while also having unique advantages that cater to individual preferences. In this essay, I will elaborate on my viewpoint.\nOn one hand, team sports like football offer several advantages to participants. They provide an opportunity to develop a sense of unity, forge friendships, and enhance teamwork among teammates. These skills not only apply to the sporting arena but also prove valuable in social and professional settings, such as work or academic environments. Additionally, team sports are conducive to honing interpersonal skills like effective communication and strategic thinking through collaborative brainstorming.\nOn the other hand, individual sports, exemplified by tennis and swimming, also possess their own merits. Engaging in individual sports allows individuals to nurture personal skills such as emotional management, stress coping mechanisms, and self-confidence. It is worth noting that these sports can contribute to increased flexibility and aid in weight management due to their physically demanding nature. Playing individual sports implies that one relies solely on their abilities, fostering a resilient mindset to confront challenging situations and bolstering self-assurance. For instance, individuals who incorporate swimming into their fitness routines can burn more than 200 calories per kilometer swum, which is particularly beneficial for those aiming to lose weight. Furthermore, individuals engaged in aerobic exercises like tennis can significantly improve their range of motion through the dynamic movements involved, such as swinging and reaching.\nIn conclusion, most sports offer substantial benefits and contribute positively to mental and physical well-being. Therefore, individuals should select their preferred sports based on their personal inclinations and goals. Whether it's team sports that emphasize teamwork and social bonds or individual sports that focus on personal development and physical fitness, the choice ultimately depends on individual preferences.\"\n"

      "paragraph": "There are differing opinions regarding the growing trend of playing video games on mobile phones or tablets and its potential harm to individuals in society. From my perspective, I wholeheartedly agree with this notion due to its adverse impacts on both well-being and productivity.\nFirstly, spending excessive time playing electronic games can lead to sedentary lifestyles. When individuals dedicate hours to sitting and engage in minimal physical activity, which lacks exercise, it can negatively affect their overall health and contribute to health problems such as obesity and muscle weakness. Additionally, an overindulgence in gaming can hinder the development of essential social skills. Investing too much time in the virtual world can lead to a decrease in social interactions as individuals become more isolated within their gaming spheres.\nAnother drawback of engaging in electronic games for leisure is its significant impact on an individual's work or academic performance. This is because gaming requires focus and concentration. The more people play or become absorbed in gaming, the more challenging it becomes to concentrate on other tasks, such as school work or one's career. To illustrate, a study has found that video game addicts tend to achieve lower grades and exhibit more disruptive behaviors, such as arguing and fighting with parents and teachers. Therefore, it is imperative for individuals to strive for a harmonious balance between recreation and work.\nIn conclusion, while electronic games can offer various benefits, it is crucial to be aware of their potential negative effects. They have the capacity to lead to a sedentary lifestyle and to diminish focus and concentration, which in turn impairs work and academic performance.\n"

      "paragraph": "Crime is a significant societal issue that demands appropriate measures for correction. Various methods are available to address this issue, and the choice between imprisonment and education/training is a matter of debate. In my view, I concur with the idea that education and training are more effective approaches.\nSending criminals to prison or providing them with education and training can both be effective ways to address their actions. The choice between punishment and rehabilitation should depend on the severity of the crime committed. Individuals who have committed serious offenses, such as murder or robbery, pose a significant risk to society and should be incarcerated in prison. This separation from the community is essential due to the severity of their actions. There is a concern that if these individuals undergo training, they might still pose a threat to society after their release. Therefore, imprisonment is necessary to prevent them from committing further crimes. In extreme cases, those who intentionally take another person's life may face the death penalty. Despite receiving a prison sentence, some individuals may not adhere to the rules, which can hinder their moral rehabilitation. This could make them even more dangerous when reintroduced into society. Additionally, overcrowding in prisons is a persistent issue, leading to violent incidents among inmates, which is a drawback of the prison system.\nOn the other hand, education and training can be more suitable for juvenile delinquents and minor offenders. When provided with education and training, these individuals can gain insights into their actions' implications for the community. Unlike prisons, where negative influences and violence can distort their thinking, education can help dispel misconceptions and lead them towards a better understanding of societal norms. Educated and trained individuals are more likely to appreciate the positive aspects of life and are less likely to engage in criminal activities.\nIn conclusion, the choice between sending criminals to prison or providing them with education and training should be based on the severity of their crimes. However, for less serious offenders and juvenile delinquents, education and training offer a better opportunity to reintegrate into society and reduce the overall crime rate.\n"

There are various reasons for this alarming issue, and potential measures should be taken to prevent this trend.\nThere are several reasons behind the prevalence of school bullying. One of the primary causes of this problem is the significant changes in the mood and behavior of students as they reach maturity. There is a high likelihood that they are unable to control their aggressive emotions, and their self-awareness of their misbehavior may not be heightened. Consequently, a large number of conflicts within the school environment occur regularly. The lack of supervision by schools and parents is also a contributing factor to the pervasiveness of violence among students. This can be explained by the fact that they are more likely to get involved in disputes when they are not closely and adequately monitored by their teachers and guardians.\nTo successfully mitigate the problem, imperative steps need to be taken. Firstly, it is the responsibility of authorities to organize anti-bullying programs to provide essential and necessary knowledge. Students should be educated about self-defense and the risks of violence at school. When they are equipped with basic information about this problem, they are less likely to engage in violent acts. Secondly, an effective solution would be to implement regulations against physical assault. For instance, students displaying violent behaviors that negatively impact others should be suspended from school and criticized severely. As a result, they are far less likely to repeat such actions.\nIn conclusion, despite the various causes of school bullying, it is by no means impossible to solve if the aforementioned solutions are strictly followed.\n"

However, there is an opposing view that asserts that anyone can become a proficient athlete or musician through dedicated practice. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and offer my own opinions.\nFirstly, there is substantial evidence to support the idea that natural talent plays a significant role in determining success in sports and music. For instance, research has demonstrated that many athletes and accomplished musicians often possess certain physical or cognitive skills that provide them with an advantage over others. Musicians, for instance, who can play a musical instrument at a high level, frequently exhibit a heightened sense of rhythm and melody, which is not as common among the general population.\nOn the other hand, it is also true that practice and commitment can assist individuals in becoming proficient athletes and musicians. For instance, individuals who meticulously plan their journey, including goal-setting, seeking feedback, and addressing their weaknesses, can acquire expertise in their respective fields. This implies that even individuals who lack a natural aptitude for sports or music can achieve success if they invest time and effort.\nIn my opinion, both viewpoints have their merits. While natural talent may provide some individuals with an advantage, it is not the sole determinant of success. Diligence, dedication, and enthusiasm are equally crucial factors that can enable anyone to attain greater success in their chosen fields. Therefore, I believe that while natural talent may be advantageous, it is not indispensable for achieving success.\nIn conclusion, it is challenging to definitively answer whether natural talent or nurture is more crucial. While there is evidence to suggest that innate talent plays a role, it is also evident that practice and hard work can enable anyone to excel. Consequently, I am of the belief that both factors are vital, and that anyone can become a proficient athlete or musician if they are willing to invest effort and determination.\n"

This trend can be attributed to several factors, such as the belief that academic qualifications ensure the knowledge and professionalism necessary in new employees. However, in my view, this inclination yields adverse consequences for the following reasons.\nIndividuals with formal academic qualifications are perceived to have several advantages over their counterparts. Firstly, recruiters may consider degree holders to be well-versed in academic knowledge, which is deemed essential for the job they are seeking. For instance, in specialized fields like auditing or strategic planning, where precise and in-depth understanding is crucial, individuals with only life experience may struggle to meet the demands, potentially exposing the company to significant risks. Moreover, students who successfully attain these qualifications often demonstrate their potential as diligent and dedicated employees. Their commitment to pursuing intellectual excellence during their university education reflects their strong work ethic.\nNonetheless, this trend also carries certain drawbacks, and academic degrees should not always take precedence in the hiring process. To begin with, the selection criteria should be tailored to the specific job, its responsibilities, and requirements. Entry-level candidates, for instance, may encounter challenges when dealing with clients and partners due to their limited life and business experience, which can tarnish the company's image. Secondly, gaining relevant work experience may take longer than acquiring academic degrees, and personal qualities tend to be relatively stable and resistant to swift change. Qualities such as punctuality and honesty are inherent and cannot be easily cultivated or altered to fit the company's work culture. Inappropriate behavior in the workplace can also pose significant threats to a company's success.\nIn conclusion, despite the apparent advantages of hiring individuals with formal academic qualifications, I firmly believe that they should not be favored over those with substantial life experience and strong personal qualities.

After considering both sides of the argument, I lean towards the negative aspects outweighing the positive ones for several reasons, as discussed in this essay.\nOn the positive side, welcoming foreign tourists can contribute to the economic development of a country. When they visit domestic tourist attractions, they spend money on various aspects of travel, including airfare, accommodation, food, and tickets. This, in turn, boosts the local economy. For example, Thailand has become a popular destination in Asia due to its excellent service and friendly residents. Since Thailand prioritized and promoted tourism, its national GDP has significantly increased. Another advantage is the enhancement of the country's image globally. This means that not only beautiful local places and historical sites but also unique customs and delicious cuisine become known to international nations through tourists' praise and positive experiences.

Many universities have opted for online courses over traditional in-person classes due to certain advantages. However, I hold the view that this shift represents a negative development.\nOn the positive side, online courses offer several benefits. Firstly, they are flexible and convenient. With the proliferation of digital technology, people can easily access the internet, enabling them to engage in online learning via smartphones or computers in today's modern world. This flexibility allows students to study in various locations and at their preferred times, eliminating the need to commute to universities. Consequently, students can save time for studying and engage in other productive activities such as sports or acquiring additional knowledge. Secondly, online courses are often more cost-effective than physical classes. Additionally, students can save on transportation expenses. This extra money can then be invested in self-improvement, be it in financial endeavors or the economic market.\nNotwithstanding the aforementioned advantages, I am inclined to believe that online education has certain drawbacks. Foremost among them is the lack of social interaction and communication skills. When universities transition from face-to-face classes to online formats, students have fewer opportunities to interact with their instructors and peers, particularly in activities like teamwork or discussions. Consequently, they may not have the chance to develop vital conversational and critical thinking skills. Secondly, according to some surveys, students who frequently take online courses may not gain as much knowledge as those who attend classes on campus.

Music holds a significant place in all human societies for various reasons, and I firmly assert that traditional music holds greater importance compared to contemporary international music.\nThere are numerous compelling reasons why music is profoundly significant in our lives. Firstly, music accompanies us throughout our existence. During childhood, we are encouraged by our caregivers and educators to sing songs as a means of acquiring language skills or simply for enjoyment. In fact, children delight in singing with others, and it is evident that group singing fosters a sense of connection among participants, regardless of their age. As we progress through life, our musical preferences evolve, and we come to regard our favorite songs as integral parts of our life narratives. Furthermore, music has the unique ability to convey and evoke emotions in ways that words alone cannot. It is challenging to envision a life devoid of music.\nIn my perspective, traditional music should be held in higher regard compared to the ubiquitous international music that has gained prominence. Undeniably, international pop music is often catchy and enjoyable, but it essentially functions as a commercial product promoted and marketed by industry professionals. In contrast, traditional music serves as a repository of a nation's culture, traditions, and history. Traditional genres, such as folk songs and ethnic melodies, connect us with our historical roots and contribute to our cultural identity.

While I acknowledge that online friendships can hold some value, I firmly believe that in-person friendships have a more profound impact on individuals' lives.\nOn the one hand, online friendships do offer certain advantages but also come with notable limitations when compared to what we expect from close friendships. Online platforms allow us to connect with a broader range of people, captivated by their curated social media lives, and establish immediate acquaintanceships. However, it is essential to recognize that people tend to showcase only glimpses of their lives, highlighting specific aspects and hobbies, making it challenging to grasp their true personality. Moreover, online friendships tend to be more intricate than real-life friendships due to the absence of physical and emotional closeness. For instance, when people interact online, they lack the ability to gauge the overall atmosphere and mood as they would when meeting face-to-face, which can lead to relationship issues.\nOn the other hand, in-person friendships are much simpler to establish and nurture. Friends can frequently meet, allowing them to develop a deep understanding of each other. This type of friendship is especially beneficial for those seeking companions who share their interests without reservation. The likelihood of finding suitable friends in real life is also higher than through social media.

This essay will delve into two primary factors contributing to this issue: the demanding workload and the absence of green spaces. Furthermore, I firmly believe that people can address these challenges by fostering a culture of exercise and organizing government-sponsored competitions.\nFirst and foremost, the arduous workload is a major impediment to regular exercise for city dwellers. These residents have to cover various expenses like food, housing, and insurance, which can place an overwhelming financial burden on them. Consequently, citizens find themselves working long hours to sustain themselves without relying on external support. Additionally, in metropolitan areas, the emphasis is often on constructing companies or factories for economic growth rather than developing public parks or sports facilities. Consequently, engaging in physical activities becomes more challenging, especially for those with limited incomes, as they must incur expenses to access gyms or sports centers.\nOn the flip side, individuals can surmount this predicament by integrating exercise into their daily routines. For instance, they can opt for stairs over elevators or engage in brief exercise sessions during work breaks. Moreover, city residents can enhance their physical well-being by dedicating time to exercise after work. Basic exercises like push-ups or sit-ups can help them maintain good health. Finally, the government can raise awareness and motivate people to exercise by organizing running or cycling competitions with enticing prizes. This approach is likely to motivate individuals to put in the effort to earn their rewards.\nIn conclusion, while the demanding workload and the lack of green spaces pose significant challenges for urban residents seeking to engage in regular physical exercise, I firmly believe that promoting exercise awareness and government-supported competitions can help people overcome these hurdles.\n"

Since most students come to university equipped with modern devices such as laptops and cellphones, which support their educational journey, they can easily access the internet to engage in online courses offered by universities.

While there are some benefits to this practice, in my opinion, teenagers should continue studying after finishing high school.

It will help teenagers gain essential social and communication skills. This is because, during their work experience, they will interact with many people, which can make them happier. Additionally, working can help them earn extra money and gain valuable skills for their future careers.

This is because traveling exposes them to diverse people and situations, allowing them to make new friends and become more self-reliant.\nDespite the above-mentioned advantages, I believe that teenagers should continue their studies after finishing high school and starting university. The main reason is that if they work and do not continue their studies, they may forget the knowledge they gained in high school and face challenges when they eventually return to their studies. After finishing high school, it is reasonable for them to spend about 2 to 3 months working and traveling. However, if they spend the entire year doing that, they may fall behind in their college studies.\nMoreover, prolonged travel can lead to increased expenses and potential health issues. In conclusion, while there are many benefits to teenagers working and traveling after high school, such as improved physical and social well-being, I contend that teenagers should not be encouraged to do so for the entire year.

Consequently, the use of transportation, which contributes significantly to environmental problems, continues to increase day by day. Some governments have opted to raise the price of petrol in an effort to limit the number of cars and other vehicles on the road. While I believe that increasing fuel prices could be quite effective in addressing environmental issues, I also recognize that there are more impactful measures that should be considered.\nProtecting the environment is a vital responsibility that governments should undertake annually. Adjusting fuel prices is indeed an effective method to reduce transportation. Consequently, car owners and drivers will likely reduce their journeys. People may opt for public transport instead of private vehicles to save money. In this regard, national authorities should improve and expand public transportation systems and encourage citizens to use buses or subways, which can help reduce traffic accidents. Furthermore, not only individuals who operate cars or motorcycles are affected by the cost of petrol, but the delivery of goods is also influenced. From the perspective of freight services, they should explore alternative modes of transporting goods, such as rail or ship, for instance. Undoubtedly, these measures would decrease exhaust emissions into the air, contribute to mitigating the greenhouse effect, and restore a cleaner atmosphere.\nIn contrast to the approach of adjusting fuel costs, there are additional measures that can be implemented to address environmental issues. The government can enact new regulations to control the increasing use of private cars. In Vietnam, for example, the national authorities have recently revised the driving test to make it more challenging than before. Additionally, many companies have begun manufacturing electric vehicles, such as motorbikes, bicycles, or scooters. People are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of preserving our environment. Therefore, these commuting products are highly appealing due to their functionality and value.\nIn conclusion, while controlling fuel prices is a valuable step, a comprehensive approach that involves government policies, citizen participation, and the promotion of eco-friendly transportation options is crucial for effectively combating environmental issues.\n"

      "question": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of online shopping?",
      "paragraph": "Currently, there is a growing trend of people turning to online shopping instead of traditional in-store purchases. In my view, this shift brings about both favorable and unfavorable consequences, as discussed below.\nOn the positive side, online shopping offers several advantages. Firstly, it is a faster and more cost-effective way to shop, as individuals can acquire products from the comfort of their homes without the need to visit physical stores or shopping centers. For instance, popular websites like Amazon and eBay offer an extensive range of products, enabling customers to make purchases effortlessly, ultimately saving them time and travel expenses. Secondly, online shopping provides people with a broader array of options, allowing them to compare various brands and products. For instance, shoppers can easily compare Converse and Adidas shoes, a task that may be challenging in physical stores.\nOn the flip side, online shopping does have its share of drawbacks. The primary disadvantage is that customers cannot physically assess products before making a purchase. For example, a person cannot try on a dress to determine if it fits properly. Furthermore, products sold online may not always meet expectations in terms of quality and reliability. The items delivered to customers' homes may sometimes exhibit lower quality than anticipated. Lastly, due to the convenience and affordability of online shopping, people often indulge in excessive buying, leading to significant financial waste. This is less likely to occur if shopping in physical stores remains the dominant mode of shopping.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the shift from traditional in-store shopping to online shopping has both positive and negative aspects.\n"

      "question": "What are the pros and cons of making university education free for all students?",
      "paragraph": "I partially agree with the idea that university education should be made available to all students for free. This policy can foster innovation and creativity while equipping students with the essential knowledge and skills needed to create new products and advance technologies, ultimately benefiting the country's progress. Moreover, providing free university education can alleviate the financial strain on parents who support their children's higher education. When students attend university, they face various expenses, such as housing, utilities, and food. Offering tuition-free education can ease this financial burden and enable students to embark on their careers without the added pressure of debt.\nHowever, I hold reservations about completely subsidizing university education. Several reasons underpin my stance. Firstly, there is a potential risk to the quality of education. When education becomes entirely free, it may result in a reduction in the diversity of courses offered, a decline in teaching standards, or limitations in the availability of educational resources. Secondly, such a policy would place a new financial burden on society. The reason for this concern lies in the significant cost associated with higher education, which could necessitate increased taxes for everyone, not solely benefiting those directly pursuing university education.\nIn summary, while I support the notion of providing free university education for its potential to drive innovation and reduce financial stress on students and their families, I also recognize the need for caution. We must carefully consider the potential drawbacks, such as compromised educational quality and the broader financial implications for society as a whole.\n"

      "paragraph": "Nowadays, we have various options for commuting within cities, including buses, trains, and private cars. While many people recognize the advantages of cycling to some extent, I would argue that cycling also has its drawbacks.\nOn the one hand, bicycles offer advantages for both individuals and society. Firstly, cycling can serve as a regular form of exercise, contributing to improved fitness. Therefore, frequent bicycle commuting can lead to enhanced well-being and mental health. For example, having a daily cycling routine to work or school can be an excellent workout for anyone. Secondly, if a substantial number of people opt for bicycles as their mode of transport, it can lead to a gradual reduction in emissions compared to conventional driving. This reduction contributes to decreased air pollution, which is crucial for maintaining a healthy environment. If everyone opts for private cars or motorbikes, the increased release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere could lead to global warming and negatively impact the living environment.\nOn the other hand, I would argue that cycling comes with some significant drawbacks. Firstly, as cities expand, it becomes challenging to rely solely on bicycles for urban transportation. Consequently, people tend to use bicycles for shorter distances to ensure they reach their destinations on time. If individuals choose cycling as their primary means of transportation, they would need a well-planned schedule and a reasonable level of physical fitness. Secondly, cycling requires a well-developed parking system. Therefore, while it does reduce emissions compared to cars or motorbikes, cycling can still contribute to pollution through construction activities and consume significant public funds.\nIn conclusion, while cycling has its benefits for various reasons, I still believe that other modes of transport, such as public transportation like buses and trains, are more suitable for urban areas at the present time.\n"

      "paragraph": "Online shopping is the primary cause behind the decline of many high street shops in recent years. This trend has both positive and negative aspects.\nIn terms of structure, I recommend organizing your essay into four paragraphs as follows:\nNow, let's delve into the main ideas for each of these paragraphs.\nOnline shopping offers advantages such as speed, cost-effectiveness, and convenience. People can effortlessly browse for the best deals from the comfort of their homes, make purchases, and have their items delivered within a day. This level of convenience is something that physical stores find nearly impossible to match. For instance, I recently used Amazon to purchase some relatively rare academic textbooks that were not available at my local bookstore. The vast array of products accessible online makes it increasingly less attractive for me to visit traditional high street shops.\nPositives and negatives arise from this shift. On the positive side, online shopping provides an extensive array of choices, serving as a solution for busy individuals or those with limited mobility who cannot venture out. However, this trend also leads to rising unemployment rates as high streets become desolate, resulting in a loss of community and vibrancy. When high street shops disappear, they take with them the sense of a shared space where people can gather and interact.\nIn conclusion, the disappearance of high street shops can be attributed to the competitive edge of online shopping platforms, which offer affordability and convenience. While online shopping provides a vast selection of products and caters to the needs of busy or housebound individuals, it also leads to job losses and the erosion of community spirit in deserted high streets.\nYour essay is now more organized and clear.

      "paragraph": "University education has long played a pivotal role in advancing human society. Consequently, many advocate for universal access to higher education, regardless of students' financial backgrounds. While this notion is not without merit, it does present some significant drawbacks.\nForemost among these is the issue of cost. Allocating substantial funds to make university education free for all can strain government resources, potentially compromising their ability to function effectively. Furthermore, this approach may necessitate higher taxation, which could be deemed unfair by individuals who do not have children attending university. Additionally, the expansion of university enrollment leads to increased demands for infrastructure and facilities. Unfortunately, this may again burden the government with additional financial responsibilities, potentially requiring further tax increases, or it may result in a decline in the quality of education due to a reduction in the number of available courses.\nConversely, the primary advantage of free university education, and the reason many support it, is that it offers equal educational opportunities to all students, regardless of their financial circumstances. This means that economically disadvantaged students can enjoy improved learning environments and better employment prospects after graduation. Furthermore, such a policy is likely to inspire more students to pursue higher education, ultimately enhancing their quality of life and social standing.\nIn conclusion, the debate over whether university education should be universally free is a complex one. While the idea holds appeal due to its promotion of equal opportunities, it is essential to consider the financial implications and potential challenges it may pose for governments. Striking a balance between affordability and quality in higher education is crucial for the sustainable development of society.\n"

      "paragraph": "In my view, orchestrating a grand family celebration, such as a wedding, engagement, or birthday, holds profound significance for the family. Nonetheless, if this task is undertaken without meticulous preparation and a comprehensive perspective, it can give rise to various significant issues. These issues can manifest in various facets of the event planning process, possibly stemming from the way the venue is adorned, disagreements in opinions among family members, or oversight in the preparations. Furthermore, the financial aspect also poses a considerable burden, as substantial investments are required.\nTo effectively address these challenges, I propose some practical and sensible solutions. First and foremost, it is imperative to formulate a well-thought-out plan before embarking on any preparations. This plan should outline the anticipated expenses for decorations and anticipate and mitigate potential issues that may arise during the course of the event. Secondly, it is crucial to meticulously list the guests who will be invited in a sequential and accurate manner, ensuring that no one is inadvertently omitted.\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, the attitude and cooperation of every family member play a pivotal role. Organizing such a significant event can be incredibly taxing and demanding, but when each family member exhibits care, mutual assistance, and a willingness to collaborate, the results are truly remarkable. I am confident that with this approach, regardless of the event's scale, it can be orchestrated successfully.\nIn conclusion, when undertaking the organization of a large family celebration, it is imperative to have a well-structured plan and meticulous attention to detail.

While this trend can have some benefits, I believe that offering online courses can have both positive and negative effects on students as well as teachers.\nOn the positive side, there are several reasons why I believe internet-based learning is beneficial for students. Firstly, it is particularly attractive to students who reside in remote areas or international students. This is because they may face challenges commuting to school, especially in adverse weather conditions. Online classes provide an opportunity for all learners to participate in class without the need for physically attending a campus. Additionally, online learning offers flexibility. It allows students to access lectures and educational resources from around the world. Consequently, they can expand their knowledge and gain insights from various cultures, which can be valuable during their academic journey in tertiary institutions and beyond. In fact, thanks to internet-based learning, students can accumulate diverse experiences that serve as tools to help them succeed in the future, especially when they apply for employment opportunities.\nOn the flip side, online learning can have some negative impacts on students. Firstly, it may reduce interactions between students and their instructors. This is often due to technical issues, such as connectivity problems or disruptions caused by weak Wi-Fi signals. Additionally, some students may choose not to turn on their cameras during online classes, which hinders their ability to engage with teachers and peers. Consequently, they miss out on expanding their social circles and lack the support and guidance that professors can provide. Furthermore, many students are susceptible to distractions when attending online courses. This distraction often stems from the fact that young people tend to have difficulty maintaining focus without the physical presence of their instructors as they would in traditional classrooms. According to a recent survey conducted by America News, many freshmen reported that they are frequently tempted by electronic devices, such as notifications from friends and computer games, which can negatively impact their academic performance.\nIn conclusion, while online classes can offer advantages to learners, I believe that this development can also have adverse effects on both students and teachers. It is essential to weigh the pros and cons of online learning carefully and ensure that it is implemented in a way that maximizes its benefits while mitigating its drawbacks.\n"

      "question": "Should governments provide free university education to all students?",
      "paragraph": "The idea that everyone should have the opportunity to access higher education is a viewpoint I strongly agree with and support. Firstly, education is a fundamental human right that should be available to all members of society, regardless of their financial circumstances. This includes access to university-level education. Secondly, university education holds significant importance for individuals. It not only enables them to gain a deeper understanding of various subjects but also enhances their prospects of securing a well-paying job in society. Without a college degree, one's chances of finding a decent job are significantly reduced compared to those who have completed their higher education.\nHowever, the notion that governments should provide free university education to all students, regardless of their financial backgrounds, is not entirely accurate in my opinion. On one hand, it is the government's responsibility to ensure equal educational opportunities for all citizens, irrespective of their economic status. This means that individuals, whether they come from impoverished or affluent backgrounds, should have access to the same quality of education. Furthermore, funding education through tuition fees is indeed a duty of the government, as universities play a pivotal role in producing a skilled workforce, which ultimately benefits the government and the nation as a whole.\nOn the other hand, it is essential to consider that relying solely on the government to cover all educational expenses may have drawbacks. One concern is the potential decline in the quality of education. If universities are solely dependent on government funding, there may be insufficient resources to maintain high standards of teaching and infrastructure. This could lead to a deterioration in the quality of education provided. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that students should contribute a portion of their tuition fees. This not only assists in maintaining the financial health of educational institutions but also encourages students to value their education more and approach their studies with greater dedication.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the right to access higher education should be universally recognized and supported. It is a basic human right and a pathway to personal and professional growth. However, the idea that governments should make university education entirely free for all, regardless of financial backgrounds, needs to be balanced with the practical consideration of maintaining the quality of education. Therefore, a combination of government support and student contributions to tuition fees appears to be a reasonable approach that promotes both accessibility and educational excellence.\n"

In my view, while this approach can enhance their knowledge and experiences, it requires careful consideration due to potential drawbacks such as time and financial concerns.\nOn one hand, opting to work or explore different countries can offer numerous advantages to young individuals. Firstly, early employment exposes them to the business environment, helping them gain insights into potential career paths. Consequently, they can amass valuable experience and enhance their social skills. Secondly, international travel exposes them to diverse cultures, expanding their global awareness. This is particularly beneficial if they plan to pursue higher education abroad.\nOn the other hand, dedicating a year to work or travel can potentially consume valuable time and financial resources for several reasons. To illustrate, recent high school graduates may encounter social challenges when entering the workforce at a young age. Additionally, some companies may offer low salaries to young employees, which may not be equitable and could lead to considerable time wastage. Furthermore, spending money on travel during this period may seem impractical, as they will need those funds for university tuition fees in the near future. They will have ample time to work and save money for travel after completing their studies.\nIn conclusion, while there are several benefits associated with young people working or traveling before pursuing higher education, it is essential for them to carefully assess their financial situation and objectives to make an informed decision that aligns with their needs and goals.\n"

While there are advantages to this idea, such as the development of crucial life skills and enhanced communication abilities, I partially disagree due to certain associated risks, including financial challenges and potential negative impacts on teenagers' health.\nOn the positive side, encouraging teenagers to engage in work or travel experiences before entering university can be beneficial to some extent. Firstly, it allows them to develop essential life skills through various activities they may undertake during this period. For instance, they can gain valuable experience by working in cafes or participating in voluntary work. Engaging in such activities helps young people acquire practical life skills. Furthermore, embarking on journeys to different countries can significantly expand their knowledge of diverse cultures and traditions, which can be extremely valuable in their personal growth and education. Additionally, young people's communication skills can greatly improve through these experiences. When working or traveling in public spaces, they are often required to interact with people from various backgrounds. Such interactions boost their confidence and ability to communicate effectively, which can be advantageous when they start university.\nConversely, there are several reasons why I believe there are disadvantages for young people who choose to pursue this path. Firstly, financial constraints can pose a significant challenge, as not all teenagers have their own financial resources. Traveling, in particular, can be costly, and finding employment that provides adequate income can be challenging for adolescents. Moreover, adapting to new work environments and unfamiliar places can be emotionally taxing and lead to feelings of depression, especially if teenagers lack support from their parents or their community. This emotional strain can also have a detrimental impact on their physical health.\nIn conclusion, while encouraging teenagers to work and travel has its merits, I still maintain that the potential drawbacks, including financial hardships and potential adverse effects on health, should not be overlooked. It is advisable for teenagers to have the support of their parents and community during this transitional phase in their lives to ensure a smoother and more positive experience.\n"

Secondly, the financial burden of hosting an event on the scale of a wedding, which can cost up to 120 million VN? or even more, can have a significant impact on the finances of lower or middle-income families.\nThirdly, the logistics of organizing such an event can be quite daunting, involving tasks like decoration, photography, and post-event cleanup. It's a complex and time-consuming endeavor. Lastly, sending out invitations and managing the guest list can be a logistical nightmare. Estimating the number of attendees can be tricky, and this can directly affect the budget. For instance, inviting a small group of 10-30 people may still result in significant expenses, while larger gatherings demand even more resources. Additionally, post-celebration responsibilities, such as cleaning up and dealing with the aftermath of drunk guests, often fall disproportionately on women, leading to stress and inconvenience.\nConsidering these challenges, I would like to suggest an alternative approach to family celebrations. Instead of organizing grand events like weddings, it might be more practical to opt for simpler gatherings. For instance, a casual family dinner or a hot pot meal can be less overwhelming and time-consuming. Hot pot meals are convenient as they require minimal preparation, offer a variety of vegetables and meats, and can be easily ordered from restaurants if you're short on time. This way, you can still enjoy quality time with family without the stress and expenses associated with elaborate celebrations.\nIn conclusion, while large family celebrations can be joyous occasions, they often come with significant challenges, including logistical, financial, and social issues.

      "paragraph": "Many individuals hold differing opinions on whether it is necessary to maintain zoos. In this essay, I will explore both sides of this issue.\nThere are several compelling arguments in favor of preserving zoos. Firstly, zoos serve as safe havens for endangered animals, protecting them from illegal poaching. Unfortunately, many individuals engage in unlawful hunting activities, driven by the desire to profit from the sale of valuable animal parts such as horns. This poses a significant threat to numerous rare species, pushing them dangerously close to extinction. Secondly, zoos play a vital role in education. They actively work to inform and educate the younger generation about the importance of conservation and biodiversity, often offering informative tours. Raising awareness among children about environmental issues is beneficial for the preservation of endangered species.\nConversely, some people contend that maintaining zoos is unnecessary due to the negative impact they can have on animals. Foremost among these concerns is the potential harm to the health of animals living in zoos. For certain exotic species, adapting to the unusual living conditions, including climate and habitat, can be extremely challenging. As a result, some animals may become dissatisfied with their zoo life. If they fail to acclimatize to their new environment and fall ill, it can ultimately affect their overall life expectancy. Additionally, the issue of animal abuse is a significant concern. In some zoos, animals are coerced into performing tricks to attract visitors. Regrettably, many staff members in these zoos lack the necessary qualifications, which can result in subpar care for the animals. Moreover, some animals may suffer severe mistreatment over time.\nIn summary, the debate over the maintenance of zoos continues, with proponents arguing for their essential role in conservation and education, while others raise valid concerns about the well-being of animals in captivity.\n"

      "paragraph": "Over the years, people have continually sought ways to safeguard the environment. Unfortunately, the use of transportation, a significant contributor to environmental problems, is steadily increasing. Some governments have contemplated raising the price of petrol in an effort to curtail the number of cars and other vehicles on the road. While I believe this approach could be effective, I would like to discuss alternative measures that might have a more substantial impact.\nProtecting the environment should be a paramount responsibility of governments every year. Modifying fuel prices is indeed an effective means to reduce transportation usage. Consequently, car owners and commuters may opt to reduce their journeys, favoring public transport to save on fuel costs. To facilitate this transition, national authorities should enhance and expand public transit systems while encouraging citizens to utilize buses or subways, ultimately reducing the occurrence of unfortunate accidents. Furthermore, the impact extends beyond personal vehicles, affecting the transportation of goods as well. Freight services should explore alternative modes, such as rail or maritime transport. These measures would undoubtedly reduce harmful exhaust emissions, help mitigate the greenhouse effect, and restore a cleaner atmosphere.\nHowever, beyond the solution of adjusting fuel prices, there are additional measures that can be implemented to address environmental concerns. Governments can enact new regulations to oversee the increasing use of private cars. For instance, the Vietnamese national authority has recently introduced a more rigorous driving test to deter casual drivers. Additionally, many companies have started producing electric vehicles, including motorbikes, bicycles, and scooters, reflecting a growing awareness of environmental preservation. Consequently, these eco-friendly commuting options are gaining considerable attention due to their functionality and value.\nIn conclusion, I acknowledge that government intervention in controlling petrol prices is one way to reduce harmful emissions.

      "paragraph": "Many individuals hold the belief that the key to reducing obesity lies in educating people, while others contend that education is ineffective in this regard. In my view, I firmly support the former argument.\nFirstly, it is essential to acknowledge the undeniable fact that the average weight of individuals has been steadily increasing over time. This trend can be attributed to the growing popularity of greasy and fast food in Western countries. The rapid proliferation of these fast-food chains has been astonishing, with some of them accumulating billions in revenue and expanding their influence globally within just a decade. A case in point is the United States, where the prevalence of fast-food consumption is notably high. Consequently, a significant portion of the population in the United States is grappling with obesity. This issue arises from a lack of awareness about the detrimental effects of such foods. Therefore, conducting workshops to educate people about the adverse impacts of these dietary choices and teaching them how to maintain a balanced diet can undoubtedly contribute to the reduction of obesity.\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that despite these educational efforts, not everyone can resist the allure of fast food. Some individuals, particularly those with blood type O, are predisposed to weight gain even when they abstain from snacks and foods high in sugar and calories. For these individuals, it is not entirely unreasonable to question the effectiveness of education in combating obesity.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that education and the promotion of healthy eating habits may not yield the same results for everyone, it would be incorrect to dismiss the value of education entirely.

Let's discuss the advantages and disadvantages of making this choice.\nOn the positive side, this practice offers several benefits. Engaging in work or experiencing life as a traveler can significantly broaden their horizons. Some young people who travel to foreign countries tend to gain knowledge about international history and famous landmarks that others may not. Furthermore, the act of working and traveling provides valuable life experiences, such as learning how to handle demanding bosses or becoming a responsible employee. These benefits may seem simple, but even if young individuals do not have specific goals in mind, taking a break from the rigors of formal education can be refreshing. Some students simply seek a period of relaxation before taking on the responsibilities of adulthood. Consequently, young people should consider working or traveling, whether for leisure or educational purposes, because this trend does indeed offer tangible advantages.\nOn the flip side, there are potential downsides to this phenomenon. Firstly, excessive work or leisure activities during this year off may alter young people's ambitions, leading them to prioritize money or personal leisure over their educational pursuits due to greediness and laziness. Students who earn a substantial income might decide not to pursue university education, and those who spend their time idly on a sunny beach may lose their motivation to return to school. In just one year, an initially diligent person could transform into a completely different individual, particularly if they are introverted by nature. For example, a studious individual or an avid Reddit user might turn into a carefree cosplayer with a substantial social media following because of this trend. Secondly, young individuals may encounter memory issues when they eventually return to school. Concepts and formulas they haven't revisited in a year can become challenging to recall, or in some cases, these notions might have faded entirely.\nIn conclusion, while seeking employment or traveling can bring about certain benefits such as expanding one's knowledge and providing a mental break, there are also notable drawbacks, including potential shifts in priorities, loss of motivation, and difficulty in recollecting important academic knowledge. I recommend considering a year of vacation or work with caution, but it's essential to maintain focus on the path to higher education. Neglecting this path could lead to academic setbacks, which can be challenging to recover from. While taking a break can be valuable, a well-earned educational certificate is undoubtedly more advantageous than having nothing in hand.

Furthermore, the overexploitation of fishing disrupts the marine food chain, causing a significant decrease in fish populations. Lastly, oil spills resulting from extraction processes have led to the deaths of thousands of marine species.\nIn conclusion, there are solutions to these pressing problems. Governments should mandate that businesses and factories install proper waste treatment systems to prevent further pollution. It is also essential to provide financial support to organizations dedicated to saving endangered species. Moreover, stricter penalties should be imposed, and public campaigns should be promoted to raise awareness about environmental conservation. By taking these measures, we can mitigate the adverse effects of human activities on both land and in the sea, safeguarding the future of our planet's precious biodiversity.\n"

      "question": "What are the benefits of learning a foreign language beyond travel and employment?",
      "paragraph": "Many argue that the sole purpose of learning a foreign language is to facilitate overseas employment and travel. However, others contend that acquiring a new language can offer more than just these two benefits. In my view, working abroad and traveling are not the only incentives for people to learn new languages; there are also multifaceted advantages beyond these utilitarian aspects.\nOn one hand, some believe that foreign language proficiency should exclusively serve those seeking employment opportunities abroad or planning foreign trips to ensure its practicality. For instance, a strong command of Japanese can enhance the career prospects of individuals working as labor exporters in Japan, potentially leading to job promotions. Furthermore, a grasp of the language spoken in the destination country enables travelers to immerse themselves in its rich culture and traditions, enhancing the quality and value of their trip.\nOn the other hand, I concur with those who assert that there are more compelling reasons to learn a new language beyond the two aforementioned purposes. Firstly, multilingual individuals have greater opportunities to forge friendships with people from other countries within their home nation. In contemporary times, international schools have gained popularity, and the diverse student body necessitates the acquisition of a second language for effective communication and comprehension of classroom instruction. Secondly, learning a new language facilitates the acquisition of knowledge. Numerous academic materials from overseas, such as documents written in French or English, are accessible to students. This access to valuable information aids in broadening their knowledge base and contributing to their academic success.\nIn conclusion, pursuing employment opportunities abroad and foreign travel are not the exclusive motivations for learning a new language. Maintaining connections with international friends and gaining access to valuable knowledge are equally significant benefits that learning new languages can bestow upon individuals.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's world, there is an ongoing debate regarding the primary purpose of learning a foreign language. Some argue that the sole reason for acquiring a new language is to facilitate travel or employment in foreign countries. However, others contend that there exist additional compelling motivations for individuals to delve into the realm of foreign languages. I wholeheartedly concur with the notion that there are more profound reasons why people should embrace new languages beyond the scope of travel or work abroad.\nUndoubtedly, mastering a foreign language can unlock numerous opportunities for individuals seeking to explore employment or travel options in a foreign land. Primarily, it allows individuals to secure longer-term work opportunities. This is because comprehending the language spoken by foreign leaders and colleagues enables seamless and efficient collaboration. Additionally, possessing knowledge of the language spoken in the country of travel provides a deeper insight into its culture and traditions. Consequently, this enhanced understanding enhances the overall travel experience, enabling greater enjoyment when visiting renowned destinations or indulging in local cuisine.\nNonetheless, I firmly believe that the advantages of language acquisition extend far beyond these practical considerations. Firstly, it broadens one's intellectual horizons by providing access to diverse realms of knowledge. Numerous invaluable books and sources of information are available in various languages. Consequently, individuals proficient in multiple languages have the privilege of tapping into a broader spectrum of knowledge.\nMoreover, language acquisition contributes significantly to one's overall well-being. Beyond adopting healthy lifestyle habits, the often-overlooked key to a fulfilling life is social connection. Learning a new language facilitates communication with people from different cultural backgrounds. This not only reduces feelings of isolation but also mitigates the risk of depression. Building relationships with individuals from diverse nations enriches one's life immeasurably.\nIn conclusion, the utility of acquiring foreign languages transcends the mere facilitation of travel and work abroad. It encompasses the enrichment of knowledge across linguistic boundaries and promotes a healthy, interconnected life. Therefore, the benefits of learning new languages are indispensable and extend well beyond the confines of international mobility and employment prospects.\n"

      "question": "Should universities primarily focus on imparting job-related skills or offer pure knowledge that might not directly benefit employers?",
      "paragraph": "In recent years, an increasing number of students have been pondering the content of their university education. The question of whether universities should primarily concentrate on imparting job-related skills or offer pure knowledge that might not directly benefit employers has sparked vigorous debates. In my opinion, universities should prioritize the development of skills relevant to employment.\nTo begin with, it is evident that the primary reason most students pursue a university education is to acquire practical knowledge that will enable them to qualify for future employment opportunities. This is because, upon graduation, the majority of them will enter the workforce to earn a living and support their families. Consequently, it is the foremost responsibility of universities to provide students with knowledge that can enhance their competitiveness in the job market.\nFurthermore, when a higher number of graduates secure employment, it enhances the reputation of the universities they attended. For instance, prospective students tend to favor universities with a higher success rate in placing their graduates in good jobs. Therefore, focusing on practical skills not only benefits the students but also enhances the prestige of the universities.\nIt is not to suggest that universities should completely disregard the importance of pure knowledge. There are, undoubtedly, students who have a keen interest in theoretical subjects such as mathematics or science. These individuals may eventually become scholars or scientists who make significant contributions to society. However, it is essential to acknowledge that such students are relatively few in number.\nIn conclusion, it is imperative that universities prioritize equipping students with the skills necessary for the workplace. Nevertheless, this does not mean universities should entirely neglect their other important roles. Striking a balance between imparting practical skills and fostering the pursuit of knowledge is crucial for universities to maintain dynamic and sustainable development.\n"

      "paragraph": "In recent years, some universities have introduced online courses as an alternative to traditional classroom-based learning. In my view, this development has both positive and negative aspects.\nOn the positive side, there are several reasons why I believe online classes can be advantageous. Firstly, online courses offer flexibility, allowing students to study from anywhere with an internet connection and a smartphone or computer. For instance, students who live far from their school can avoid the daily commute and instead learn from the comfort of their homes through their laptops or phones. This means that learning can happen at any time and in any location. Additionally, online classes provide students with easy access to a wealth of information. They can simultaneously search for supplementary materials related to their lessons while studying on their electronic devices. Consequently, students find it easier to engage with and contribute to their coursework.\nOn the other hand, I also recognize that traditional classroom-based learning has its own set of advantages that cannot be replaced. Firstly, offline classes facilitate a more direct and interactive connection between students and teachers. In contrast, online learning lacks the face-to-face interaction that is often crucial for effective teaching and learning. In a physical classroom, students can ask questions and receive immediate explanations from their teachers, which may not be as convenient in an online setting. Secondly, online learning can sometimes lead to distractions, as students need internet access, which can potentially tempt them to visit unrelated websites during their study sessions. This can negatively impact the overall quality of the lessons.\nIn conclusion, despite the trend of some universities offering online courses as an alternative to traditional classes, I firmly believe that this development has both benefits and drawbacks.\n"

      "paragraph": "There is no doubt that, in recent times, the incidence of youth involvement in criminal activities has increased. Several factors contribute to this trend, and numerous methods can be employed to address the issue.\nOne of the primary factors contributing to youth crime is negative family and environmental influences. Many young people do not have the privilege of growing up in a stable family or a balanced environment conducive to learning and personal development. Such circumstances significantly impact their behavior, mindset, and even their character, leading them to engage in socially inappropriate or even unlawful activities. For instance, when parents are preoccupied with their own responsibilities and occasionally frustrated by their children's demands, these young individuals lack guidance on distinguishing right from wrong.\nAnother significant factor is the pressure young people face in their social lives and at school. Nowadays, children and teenagers experience considerable stress in their pursuit of academic success and achieving their goals. Consequently, some may resort to criminal activities as a means of coping with this pressure, perceiving it as their only way to regain control over their lives, even if only temporarily.\nTo curb the surge in youth crime, it is crucial to understand the perspectives of young individuals. To address this issue effectively, parents must prioritize finding time within their busy schedules to ensure their children receive not only physical care but also emotional support. Furthermore, schools and society as a whole must encourage young people to discover their strengths and aspirations, helping them build confidence in their future prospects.\nIn conclusion, the rise in youth crime can be attributed to various factors within the home and school environments, necessitating proactive measures to tackle this problem.\n"

While this shift presents both advantages and disadvantages for individuals, businesses, and society as a whole, I believe that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.\nOn the one hand, business owners often express concerns about the negative impact of relocating their companies to rural areas. Firstly, they may face challenges in recruiting skilled and highly-qualified personnel due to the lower level of education in these areas. This can lead to difficulties in finding employees who can operate machinery proficiently, creating a challenging recruitment situation. Another crucial point to consider is that businesses in rural areas may experience slower growth due to a smaller customer base. This is primarily because rural areas have lower populations compared to cities, and residents there often have lower incomes. Consequently, these products may not be suitable for the local residents, resulting in reduced consumption.\nOn the other hand, the potential benefits of relocating from urban to rural areas are noteworthy. Firstly, such a move can help alleviate transportation and housing issues. When businesses relocate to rural areas, employees are required to change their accommodations to retain their jobs. Consequently, this reduces the demand for transportation and rental housing, leading to potential reductions in real estate prices and traffic congestion. Moreover, overall operational costs can decrease significantly in rural areas.

In my view, this trend offers numerous benefits.\nUndeniably, the global adoption of English does have its downsides. People may inadvertently neglect or even forget their mother tongue. For instance, a considerable number of Vietnamese children begin learning English at a very young age, often at the expense of their proficiency in Vietnamese. Consequently, this can lead to a decline in linguistic diversity and the erosion of mother tongues. However, it is essential to recognize that the advantages of English's global reach are substantial.\nThe fact that English is spoken worldwide offers significant advantages. Early exposure to English, especially for children, facilitates the exchange of knowledge with greater ease. When information is shared in a common language, it reduces the need for constant translation, resulting in smoother comprehension. Additionally, using multiple languages in daily life can stimulate the brain, enhancing cognitive abilities and making individuals more intelligent.\nFurthermore, the prevalence of English encourages people to learn additional languages. Given that proficiency in English is no longer considered exceptional, particularly in non-English speaking countries, individuals are compelled to acquire other languages to distinguish themselves. For instance, knowing languages such as Chinese or Korean can be a valuable asset on one's CV when applying to multinational corporations.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the benefits of English becoming a global language outweigh the disadvantages.

      "paragraph": "It is evident that children are dedicating more of their time to using smartphones than ever before, and there are several reasons behind this trend. While some argue that children should have full exposure to technology, I believe that this phenomenon brings about certain adverse effects, especially for young individuals. The reasons for this trend are multifaceted.\nFirstly, some parents who work full-time prefer to use smartphones as a source of entertainment or distraction for their children, rather than spending quality time playing with them. Research indicates that smartphone applications are designed to be addictive, as they trigger the release of dopamine in the human brain. Dopamine is primarily responsible for the sensation of pleasure within the brain's reward system. Consequently, as children use smartphones more frequently, they become increasingly reliant on them.\nSecondly, the technological revolution has made smartphones more accessible to the general public. Phone companies have been promoting a wide range of smartphone models at various price points, catering to individual needs, including those of children. For instance, children can now own a smartphone for an average cost of only three million Vietnamese dong, which is relatively affordable considering its numerous advantages.\nNevertheless, excessive smartphone usage often leads to a range of issues. Firstly, it can negatively impact children's health, both physically and mentally. For instance, excessive screen time and a lack of physical activity due to smartphone addiction can result in physical health problems such as obesity and poor posture. Mentally, constant exposure to screens may lead to increased anxiety and diminished social interaction skills, ultimately affecting a child's emotional well-being and overall quality of life.\nSecondly, cyberbullying has become a significant concern. Children may be less cautious about sharing personal information online, making them vulnerable to cyberbullies. For example, a teenager who spends a substantial amount of time on social media platforms might share their location, daily routines, or even personal photos, assuming they are interacting with trusted friends. However, this information can be exploited by cyberbullies, who can use it to harass the teenager or engage in other harmful behaviors, thereby posing a threat to the child's online safety and mental well-being.\nIn conclusion, excessive smartphone use among children not only jeopardizes their health but also exposes them to a higher risk of cyberbullying. It is essential to use smartphones with thoughtful consideration, taking into account the potential risks and negative consequences associated with their excessive usage.\n"

In my opinion, while newspapers have their merits, modern digital media platforms offer greater benefits to news consumers in today's digital age.\nSupporters of the idea that newspapers are the best source of news often emphasize their reliability. It is true that newspapers are typically crafted by professional journalists and undergo rigorous editing processes to ensure accuracy in spelling, grammar, and information delivery. This meticulous approach enhances the readability and credibility of news articles in newspapers. However, this argument has some limitations. The editorial and publishing processes in newspapers can be time-consuming, leading to delays in news dissemination. This issue becomes particularly evident in fast-paced situations like the Covid-19 pandemic, where newspapers struggled to keep up with the rapidly increasing number of cases and the swift progress in vaccine development.\nTo bolster my viewpoint, it is essential to recognize the power of the Internet and social media platforms in delivering news instantaneously and engaging readers. Firstly, the Internet allows virtually anyone to share news updates at any time. Platforms such as Facebook and TikTok have the potential to provide real-time information, keeping readers well-informed about current events for better preparedness. Moreover, online news articles and websites often feature interviews and descriptive videos, while readers can actively participate in discussions through comment sections. This not only makes the news-reading experience more engaging but also enables readers to gain deeper insights into the issues being discussed.\nIn conclusion, while newspapers may offer a higher level of reliability compared to online news sources, they are not the most effective way to access news in today's digital era. The Internet and its various applications provide a faster and more engaging means of obtaining news, making them the preferred choice for many news consumers.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's world, many individuals find themselves compelled to relocate in search of job opportunities due to the intense competition in the job market. This essay aims to explore the advantages and disadvantages of this phenomenon, ultimately leaning towards the belief that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that starting a new life far from home can offer certain advantages. To begin with, individuals may have a better chance of securing well-paying job opportunities, especially in economically developed nations or regions like Japan or the USA. This can lead to increased job satisfaction and faster career advancement, which many employees aspire to achieve. Additionally, the social circle of those who move away from their loved ones and acquaintances may expand significantly. This is supported by the fact that exposure to the local community allows individuals to meet new people and form new friendships.\nHowever, despite these advantages, I firmly believe that the disadvantages of this trend are more prominent for several compelling reasons. Firstly, it is essential to consider the financial burden that relocated individuals must bear. To elaborate, the initial salary when starting a new job may be insufficient to cover essential expenses such as housing and transportation, leading to financial stress and hardship. Another significant concern is the feeling of homesickness and isolation experienced by those who are separated from their friends and families. This is a result of the limited opportunities for direct interaction and quality time spent with loved ones.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that relocating for work can offer several benefits, I am of the opinion that the drawbacks outweigh the advantages.\n"

      "paragraph": "It is undeniable that one of the most important aspects of an individual's life is education. During primary and secondary school, we all progress through our studies at the same pace. However, upon completing high school, we are faced with a pivotal decision: pursue higher education at a university or enter the workforce immediately. While some individuals firmly believe that pursuing a university degree is the optimal path to a successful career, others contend that entering the workforce right after school is a superior choice. In this essay, we will explore both perspectives and offer my opinion on the matter.\nCertainly, many people endorse the idea that pursuing higher education at a university is the superior option. There is ample evidence supporting this viewpoint, such as the potential for higher-paying job opportunities for university graduates. Additionally, obtaining a degree often carries with it a higher social status. For instance, consider how you might perceive a person with a degree or certification in comparison to someone without such credentials. Would you treat them equally, or might you favor the individual with higher academic achievements? While pursuing a university education offers numerous advantages, it also comes with its fair share of drawbacks, including the substantial cost of tuition and the highly competitive selection process that places significant stress on students.\nIn contrast to pursuing higher education, choosing to enter the workforce immediately after school typically leads to jobs like waitressing, opening one's own shop, or engaging in other entry-level positions. By entering the workforce early, individuals gain practical experience ahead of their university-educated peers. Nevertheless, when compared to those who pursued higher education, they often find themselves with lower salaries and a less prestigious social status. This situation can make life considerably more challenging, impacting one's ability to find a partner. Even if a partner is found, they may also face financial hardships if they do not possess a job themselves.\nIn conclusion, the choice between attending university or entering the workforce immediately after school is a matter of individual judgment and personal circumstances. In my view, pursuing a university education is undoubtedly the superior choice due to the array of advantages it offers.\n"

      "paragraph": "Achieving success often entails a challenging journey that demands unwavering perseverance. Moreover, the choice of the right path to practice and gradual improvement plays a pivotal role in helping us attain our goals. This essay delves into the ongoing debate between pursuing higher education at a university or college and entering the workforce immediately after completing school. I will explore both perspectives and offer my personal viewpoint.\nEnrolling in a university undoubtedly offers numerous advantages, and the first benefit I would like to discuss is the ample time it provides for contemplating one's future career. Spending several years in a university not only allows us to forge meaningful friendships but also provides a suitable environment for refining our career plans. Professors are always willing to offer valuable guidance when faced with obstacles. Furthermore, participating in clubs related to your interests can broaden your knowledge in various fields that are essential for a successful career. For instance, students studying business administration can access trending ideas by joining the Music Club or delve into the origins of humanity through participation in the Biology Club.\nHowever, the lack of practical experience can be a significant drawback for university graduates, leading to a higher rejection rate in job interviews. With the exception of those who engage in field trips and practical initiatives to address societal issues such as illiteracy or hunger, most students tend to focus solely on academic theories. Consequently, they may become disheartened when confronted with the challenges of job interviews after graduation.\nIn contrast, entering the workforce immediately after high school does not result in experience deficiency. For this reason, many individuals opt for employment instead of pursuing further education. Compared to their peers in university, these individuals often possess a more realistic and profound understanding of life. Their practical insights into how the world operates can pave the way for quicker success.\nHowever, there are significant downsides to entering the workforce immediately. Individuals without academic qualifications may find themselves unqualified for certain positions, leading to manual labor jobs due to their limited knowledge.\nWhile entering the workforce right after school can be an effective approach, I personally prefer attending university. I believe it offers the best opportunity to gain both valuable experiences and knowledge, both of which I consider essential. This approach reminds me to remain diligent every day.\nIn conclusion, both pursuing higher education at a university and entering the workforce directly after school have their merits and drawbacks. Nevertheless, the most optimal path to success is determined by your individual circumstances and mindset.\n"

      "paragraph": "\"Happiness is often considered one of the most crucial aspects of an individual's life. However, it can be challenging to define because some people struggle to establish the criteria for their own happiness. Determining what makes us happy can vary from simple to complex factors, such as having comfortable living conditions, a stable job, and strong social connections, or pursuing significant goals and relishing every facet of life. The difficulty in defining happiness often stems from a lack of clear personal objectives, as many individuals may not realize what truly brings them contentment. It's important to note that happiness need not be overly intricate; what truly matters is feeling a sense of accomplishment.\nPeople who find happiness in their lives are often those who have achieved the goals they set for themselves. However, there is a common misconception that achieving happiness means reaching the pinnacle of one's life, leaving no room for further desires. This misconception elevates happiness to an unattainable pedestal. In reality, individuals can be content with their accomplishments while still aspiring for more.\nDelineating one's own happiness and actually attaining it are two distinct endeavors. To attain happiness, we must work on self-improvement. What steps should we take, and how do we approach this journey? The answers are straightforward: continue pursuing activities you are passionate about, stay determined, and do not surrender when faced with obstacles. Adaptability and perseverance are crucial. Equally important is the realization that you don't have to embark on this journey alone; your loved ones, friends, and family can provide invaluable support.\nIn conclusion, finding happiness means discovering joy in life and identifying the sources of love, contentment, and achievement. Importantly, it doesn't have to be an elusive, distant goal. Achieving happiness requires continuous progress while keeping your true desires in sight, with the valuable support of those around you.\"\n"

      "paragraph": "The question of whether there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime is a complex one, with strong arguments on both sides.\nThose who believe in fixed punishments argue that it is the fairest way to ensure that everyone who commits the same crime receives the same punishment, regardless of their individual circumstances. They also argue that fixed punishments deter crime, as potential criminals will be less likely to commit a crime if they know that they will receive a predetermined punishment.\nOn the other hand, those who believe that the circumstances of an individual crime should always be taken into account argue that fixed punishments are not always fair. They point out that two people who commit the same crime may have very different motivations and circumstances, and that these factors should be considered when deciding on a punishment. They also argue that fixed punishments can lead to injustice, as a person who commits a crime under extenuating circumstances may receive the same punishment as someone who commits the same crime with no justification.\nThere is no easy answer to the question of whether there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Both sides have valid points, and the best approach may vary depending on the specific crime and the circumstances of the individual case.\nIn my opinion, the best approach is to have a system of fixed punishments that is flexible enough to take into account the circumstances of an individual crime. For example, a crime like murder could have a fixed punishment of life imprisonment, but the judge could have the discretion to reduce the sentence if there are extenuating circumstances, such as if the murder was committed in self-defense.\nThis approach would ensure that everyone who commits a crime receives a fair punishment, while also allowing for flexibility in cases where the circumstances warrant it.\n"

This poses a threat to our security, and one proposed solution is to provide education to prisoners so that they can find employment upon their release. In my view, I strongly agree with this perspective for several reasons.\nFirst and foremost, it is clear that educating criminals is crucial for their cognitive development, serving as a fundamental foundation for their future prospects. Through proper education, inmates can gain a better understanding of moral values and develop greater self-awareness. For instance, courses on ethics and personal development can help them comprehend the consequences of their actions and make positive changes in their lives. This enables them to effectively distinguish between detrimental and advantageous aspects of their lives and enhances their awareness.\nOn the other hand, such educational initiatives can equip former prisoners with valuable skills and qualifications, making them well-prepared to secure job opportunities upon their release. For example, vocational training programs can teach practical skills that are in demand by various companies, increasing their chances of successfully reintegrating into society. Moreover, ex-offenders are likely to contribute to the nation's development by engaging in gainful employment. Consider the case of Hai Banh, a notorious convict in Vietnam. After leaving prison, he opened his own restaurants and became involved in more charitable organizations, demonstrating the positive impact of education on formerly incarcerated individuals.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that providing proper education to offenders in prison not only helps them pursue gainful employment but also contributes to reducing the crime rate in our nation.

      "paragraph": "In recent times, we have witnessed a significant increase in the production of consumer goods, a trend that has unfortunately contributed to the degradation of our natural world. This complex issue stems from various factors, and finding a solution requires a collective effort involving all stakeholders.\nSeveral factors contribute to the expansion of the consumer industry and its subsequent negative impact on the environment. Chief among these is the rapid growth of consumerism. As the demand for goods rises, the need for increased production becomes evident. Consequently, industries engaged in manufacturing these goods intensify their use of water, energy, and raw materials, leading to the depletion of our precious natural resources. This challenge is worsened by inadequate environmental regulations that often fail to discourage factories from releasing hazardous chemicals and toxic emissions into the surroundings.\nAddressing these pressing environmental concerns requires cooperation from individuals, businesses, and governmental bodies. Firstly, it is essential for governments to launch campaigns aimed at enhancing public awareness of the dire environmental consequences of rampant consumerism. Equipped with a comprehensive understanding of these consequences, individuals are more likely to adopt environmentally friendly behaviors, such as reducing excessive consumption and transitioning to eco-friendly alternatives. This shift in consumer behavior, in turn, puts pressure on companies and manufacturers to adopt more sustainable practices. At the same time, it is crucial to strengthen penalties against factories that neglect proper waste management, including longer business suspensions and legal consequences for those responsible for environmental violations. This two-pronged strategy holds promise for significantly mitigating the detrimental effects of increased consumer goods production on the environment.\nIn conclusion, the uncontrolled growth of consumerism, combined with lax environmental regulations, has led to the expansion of the consumer industry, which significantly impacts our environment. Nevertheless, this challenge can be effectively addressed through coordinated efforts from governments, citizens, and corporate entities.\n"

In my perspective, this trend can bring about both favorable and unfavorable consequences for our generation.\nThere are several reasons why acquiring news via the Internet is a beneficial trend. Firstly, it offers great convenience for people to access the Internet and stay updated on world news. With a simple click on the screen and the availability of social networking sites, people can easily access the latest information, both locally and internationally. For instance, if you are studying abroad in a foreign country, you would likely seek news from your hometown on Google. Secondly, online news is updated more swiftly compared to newspapers or television.

Nevertheless, a debate persists regarding the necessity of punishment in this context. In my view, I concur that employing appropriate methods of discipline can yield more benefits than drawbacks.\nOn one hand, punishment can facilitate a shift in children's awareness. Their inherently innocent and naive nature often prevents them from comprehending the consequences of their actions fully. Consequently, punishment serves as a means to address this issue in a more fundamental manner. A gentle reminder may not suffice for particularly obstinate children; therefore, parents may resort to issuing warnings or employing mild corrective measures. For example, when children exhibit undesirable behaviors such as lying or laziness, parents can impose household chores as a form of punishment.\nHowever, it is imperative that parents and teachers choose effective methods to cultivate children's moral values. Severe physical punishments should be discouraged due to their detrimental impact on a child's psychological and physical well-being. Instead, parents can opt for educational forms of discipline, such as assigning additional household and homework tasks, increasing study time, limiting recreational activities, or reducing allowances to discourage wasteful spending on non-productive pursuits. Similarly, teachers should refrain from resorting to corporal punishment or humiliation, opting instead for constructive methods like requiring students to acknowledge their mistakes in writing to promote discipline within the classroom or assigning extra homework as a means of education.\nIn conclusion, it is my belief that punishment plays a significant role in educating children about the distinction between right and wrong.

This policy might dissuade students from expanding their historical knowledge, as they may find museum visits financially prohibitive, depriving them of the invaluable firsthand experience of historical artifacts. Alternatively, they do have alternative sources for historical knowledge at their disposal, such as documentaries or textbooks. Nevertheless, textbooks and documentaries tend to be quite academic, which can lead students to lose interest in history. Consequently, museum exhibitions, with their tangible reality, offer a more engaging platform for students to connect with history.\nOn the other hand, I believe that the advantages of implementing an entry fee outweigh the disadvantages.

While there will certainly be some negative consequences associated with this trend, there are steps that societies can take to address these potential problems.\nLiving in a bustling city can pose several challenges for young people. Firstly, young individuals may find it challenging to secure stable employment in a large metropolis. This is primarily because the increasingly competitive job market can be attributed to the influx of younger residents, leading to a situation where less experienced job applicants may struggle to find well-paying positions. Secondly, as the urban population continues to grow rapidly, the cost of living in metropolitan areas tends to become excessively high compared to rural regions.

From my perspective, while there are valid reasons why real-life experiences can contribute to a youth's development of good behavior, I strongly agree that young people learn more from books and movies.\nOn one hand, some argue that real-life experiences can strongly influence a child's behavior. The main reason behind this viewpoint is that these experiences unfold in reality, providing teenagers with daily observations that can instill good behavior as a habit. For instance, when they witness older family members lending a helping hand to neighbors or those in need, these acts serve as lasting impressions. They are then likely to emulate such actions in their interactions, gradually incorporating them into their own personalities.\nOn the other hand, today's technological advancements have made it easier for young people to access books and movies from the comfort of their homes, leading them to prefer these sources of entertainment over outdoor activities. Consequently, most of the knowledge they acquire about ideal behavior comes from books or movies. Furthermore, these media tailored for teenagers often contain curated content, allowing parents to oversee the values and knowledge their children absorb.

While this viewpoint has some merit, I contend that the impact of technology can be mitigated through government efforts to foster social cohesion.\nIt is evident that some argue that technological progress may widen the chasm between the rich and the poor. The main argument centers on the fact that technology often necessitates significant investments in research and infrastructure. These investments may be more accessible to affluent individuals or corporations, granting them a competitive edge and the ability to amass wealth. Consequently, those lacking resources or access to technology may struggle to keep pace and could become further marginalized. Moreover, automation and artificial intelligence have the potential to disrupt traditional job markets by automating routine and repetitive tasks, resulting in joblessness in certain sectors. This can particularly affect low-skilled workers, who may encounter challenges in finding alternative employment or require retraining. Consequently, income disparities may widen, benefiting high-skilled workers while intensifying competition for low-skilled jobs.\nNevertheless, despite the aforementioned argument suggesting that technology's development might increase the gap between the rich and the poor, I am of the opinion that technology also offers opportunities to reduce inequality. With enhanced access to information and communication technologies, marginalized communities can bridge the digital divide, gaining access to educational resources and job opportunities. Furthermore, technology has the potential to address societal challenges in sectors such as healthcare, energy, environment, and agriculture. Innovations in these areas can lead to improved access to quality healthcare, renewable energy solutions, and enhanced food production, thus diminishing disparities in essential needs and elevating overall living standards for citizens.\nIn conclusion, while it is conceivable that technology could widen the income gap between the rich and the poor, I do not fully subscribe to the notion that it inevitably leads to heightened income inequality. I believe that adopting inclusive approaches to technology, investing in education and skill development, and implementing supportive policies for the economically disadvantaged can harness technology's potential to bridge divides, reduce disparities, and promote more equitable outcomes.\n"

      "question": "Why is educating inmates in prison the most effective way to reduce crime and promote social reintegration?",
      "paragraph": "In today's fast-paced society, a noticeable trend has emerged, wherein an increasing number of criminals pose a threat to our security due to their lack of education. Consequently, educating inmates in prison is considered the most effective approach to address this issue. From my perspective, I strongly support this viewpoint for the following reasons.\nFirst and foremost, it is evident that education plays a vital role in the cognitive development of criminals, serving as a fundamental cornerstone for their future prospects. Through proper education, offenders can gain a profound understanding of moral development and human awareness. For instance, they learn about the value of freedom and life, fostering a more optimistic outlook. This enables them to effectively distinguish between harmful and beneficial aspects of their lives, enhancing their overall awareness.\nMoreover, providing educational opportunities in prison can help former inmates actively pursue job opportunities, thereby preventing their social isolation. When criminals engage in vocational programs while incarcerated, they not only expand their theoretical knowledge but also gain practical experience, ultimately transforming into productive members of society. Additionally, ex-offenders are more likely to contribute to the nation's development through gainful employment. This, in turn, bridges the gap between former prisoners and the general public, fostering a more inclusive and harmonious community.\nTake Hai Banh, a well-known offender in Vietnam, as an example. After his release from prison, he successfully established his own restaurants and initiated charitable organizations that benefit society, thanks to his newfound education and skills.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that providing offenders with proper education during their time in prison is crucial for their successful reintegration into society and their pursuit of well-paying jobs. Furthermore, this approach has the potential to reduce the overall crime rate in the nation.\n"

      "paragraph": "In some countries, many young people find themselves with very little free time and are under significant pressure to excel in their studies. This essay will explore the reasons behind this situation and suggest potential solutions to mitigate its adverse effects.\nThere are several factors contributing to this phenomenon, with two key factors being parental expectations and heightened competition for academic success. Firstly, parents often have high expectations for their children's academic performance. In many traditional families, there is a strong desire for children to achieve outstanding results in their studies. Consequently, parents often enroll their children in extra classes and push them to devote most of their time to studying. Consequently, young individuals have limited opportunities to engage in leisure activities, such as sports and spending time with friends. Secondly, increased competition, especially on social media platforms, plays a significant role in this issue. In today's digital age, social media users frequently showcase their accomplishments, leading to constant comparisons among young students. This can exert substantial pressure on children, prompting parents to enroll them in additional classes and pushing them to stay up late to prepare for exams. As a result, young people allocate the majority of their time to academics, adversely affecting their overall well-being and potentially leading to psychological problems.\nThere are several practical solutions to address these challenges, including reforming the education system and changing parents' attitudes. One effective approach is for governments and schools to revamp the education system. For instance, schools could consider reducing the duration of unnecessary subjects, such as art and music, in the curriculum and assess students using a more diverse set of criteria. This shift would enable students to have fewer classes and more time for extracurricular activities, fostering a more balanced approach to their career development. Additionally, raising parental awareness about the pressures students face in today's competitive environment is crucial. Parents should take a more supportive role and gain a deeper understanding of the heightened competition in schools, which can lead to increased stress among students. Consequently, parents should abandon a negative mindset and encourage their children to develop personal and soft skills that contribute to their overall growth.\nIn conclusion, the challenges associated with academic pressure are prevalent in today's society. However, I firmly believe that these issues can be addressed through measures such as modernizing the education system and altering parental perspectives.\n"

Furthermore, the application of technological advancements such as vacuum cleaners and self-driving cars is likely to make daily life less stressful. Over time, people will have more leisure time for recreational activities, thus enhancing their mental well-being.\nOn the other hand, there are numerous reasons to explain why many people advocate the idea that robotics technology could have adverse effects on human life. The primary rationale is that a significant increase in robotics technology in modern industries could lead to a higher rate of unemployment. Consequently, many individuals may not earn enough to support themselves and their families. Moreover, excessive reliance on robots may cause humans to become sedentary and passive in their lifestyles. Consequently, a decline in human health is likely in the near future, leading to issues like obesity and diabetes. Finally, as robots become increasingly intelligent, there is a concern that they may revolt in doomsday scenarios, outsmarting and dominating their creators.\nIn my opinion, while robots indeed have the potential to bring significant benefits to future societies, it is crucial to address the associated challenges to ensure a positive impact. The key lies in responsible development and deployment. It is imperative to establish ethical frameworks and regulations to guide the use of robots in sensitive areas and prevent potential misuse. Furthermore, efforts should be made to strike a balance between the use of robots and the preservation of human health and social interaction.\nIn conclusion, the role of robots in future societies is a complex and multifaceted issue. I believe that the benefits and negative implications of robotics technology are equally significant. It is essential to approach their development and implementation responsibly, considering the well-being of both humans and machines.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's interconnected world, where science permeates nearly every aspect of our daily lives, scientific education has become imperative. It is suggested that government leaders should allocate more funds to promote scientific education rather than other subjects to facilitate a nation's development and progress. I agree that scientists are crucial for a nation's economic and societal advancement. However, I also believe that social sciences and humanities are equally essential for comprehensive human resource development, fostering a cohesive society, and nurturing a shared national identity.\nFirstly, a country's economic growth is closely linked to advancements in science and technology, as they play a pivotal role in driving groundbreaking productivity.

      "paragraph": "In contemporary times, many experts suggest that it is beneficial for most students to commence learning foreign languages during their primary years rather than waiting until secondary school. From my perspective, the advantages of this approach outweigh the drawbacks.\nOn the one hand, there are several benefits when students are exposed to foreign languages, especially during their primary education. Research conducted by scientists indicates that the period from 6 to 10 years old is particularly conducive to acquiring new knowledge. During this phase, children's brains are at their most receptive, making it easier for them to grasp new information. For example, young children can quickly learn how to use mobile phones compared to older individuals. Additionally, in the primary school environment, children have the freedom to explore without inhibitions regarding the correctness of their foreign language usage. Furthermore, teachers are always readily available to correct pronunciation errors and provide continuous support. Last but not least, today, there are numerous international student exchange programs in many countries, providing wonderful opportunities for students who are proficient in multiple foreign languages.\nOn the other hand, while there are various advantages to learning a foreign language at an early age, there are also some disadvantages that can significantly impact children. Firstly, introducing a new language to children during their primary years may impose additional pressure on them. This is their childhood, and there may be no compelling reason to burden them with the study of other languages beyond the standard curriculum. Moreover, at this age, children may lack a strong awareness of the importance of learning new languages and may not possess the cognitive abilities to fully grasp their significance. Consequently, imparting knowledge to them can be quite challenging for both teachers and students.\nIn summary, it is evident that the advantages of introducing foreign language learning at the primary level outweigh the disadvantages. From my perspective, I strongly support the idea of teaching foreign languages to students during their primary school years.\n"

I completely disagree with this sentiment.\nAdmittedly, investing in wildlife protection can be considered a waste of money since the extinction of certain animals and birds would have no direct negative impacts on humans. This notion leads some to believe that efforts and resources directed towards wildlife conservation border on being implausible. However, this viewpoint is fundamentally flawed. In reality, there exists an inseparable connection between humankind and animal species. If one species dies out, we inevitably face the consequences. For instance, vultures play a pivotal role in disease control by scavenging carrion, so their extinction could potentially lead to concerns about disease outbreaks.\nIt is also worth noting that despite the substantial resources and attention allocated to the preservation of wild animals and birds, we have yet to achieve our goals. Governments across the globe have invested billions of dollars in wildlife conservation initiatives, including the establishment of shelters for vulnerable species. Simultaneously, they have launched extensive awareness campaigns to underscore the significance of wildlife protection. Nonetheless, thousands of species remain on the brink of extinction, and the rate of extinction is increasing.

This has led to a debate about the importance of history compared to subjects like science and technology. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view.\nOn one hand, history is a subject that provides us with stories, accounts of wars, and strategies from the past. It allows us to appreciate the bravery and intelligence of humans who lived in earlier times. Moreover, it teaches us how people in the past ventured into enemy territories without fear to secure peace, a fresh atmosphere, and protection for their countries. Therefore, history should not be neglected in schools so that children can learn about past events and take pride in the heroes of their nation. Additionally, understanding history provides context to current events and can help us prevent disasters from occurring again.\nOn the other hand, science and technology are equally vital. These subjects have undeniably led to numerous innovations and advanced devices, such as smartphones, smart televisions, and air conditioning systems. Neglecting subjects like science and technology would leave us unaware of health issues and without access to cutting-edge technology for communication. Learning these subjects improves our quality of life and keeps us up-to-date with other nations in the world.\nIn my opinion, both history and subjects related to science and technology have their own significance.

This modern trend has sparked a debate regarding the relevance of traditional schools, suggesting that children can receive their education at home. As for me, I respectfully disagree with this viewpoint, and I would like to elaborate on my reasons without making significant changes to your original essay.\nFirstly, it is essential to acknowledge that only a limited number of students possess the self-discipline required to study diligently without being easily distracted by external diversions such as online chats and video games. Consequently, there should always be a parent present at home to ensure that their children remain focused on their studies. However, this practice can often do more harm than good, as the working parent is burdened with the sole responsibility of supporting the family financially. Furthermore, parents may not always possess the pedagogical skills necessary to effectively answer their children's questions or convey knowledge to them. In contrast, sending children to school allows them to benefit from structured teaching methods employed by qualified teachers.\nAnother reason supporting my belief in the importance of traditional educational institutions lies in the unique roles that schools play. While schools are primarily seen as places for knowledge dissemination, their role in fostering socialization is often overlooked. Schools create an environment that encourages students to interact with their peers and their surroundings, an experience that cannot be replicated in an online setting. For example, activities like group discussions enable students to express their opinions independently, contributing to the development of critical thinking and the refinement of assertiveness.\nIn conclusion, I firmly uphold the indispensable role of schools because of their well-structured teaching approaches. While the Internet can undoubtedly provide valuable support for students' studies, it should be seen as a supplementary tool rather than a substitute for traditional educational institutions.

However, in my opinion, the benefits of this extended life expectancy outweigh the drawbacks.\nThe modernization and progress of medical care, along with innovative treatment options, have significantly enhanced people's longevity. On one hand, critics argue that a longer life expectancy results in a higher proportion of elderly individuals in the population. Interestingly, many of these seniors remain active and productive even in their retirement years, making valuable contributions to society. Furthermore, older generations serve as repositories of wisdom, passing down important values and traditions to the younger members of society, fostering a deeper understanding of our history.\nOn the flip side, there are several downsides to longer life expectancy. Notably, not everyone can afford top-tier medical treatment, as it often comes with a hefty price tag. Additionally, with a growing number of elderly individuals experiencing health issues, there will be an increased demand for healthcare professionals and facilities.

Conversely, others contend that the experiences encountered during adolescence, particularly in the school setting, wield greater influence. In this essay, we will delve into both perspectives and present my own viewpoint.\nOn one hand, there exists a compelling argument for the notion that pre-school experiences exert a profound impact on a child's future. This belief stems from the fact that during early childhood, children display remarkable receptivity to learning and are profoundly shaped by their surroundings, which encompass their family, caregivers, and immediate environment. To elucidate further, the quality of early experiences, such as interactions with caregivers and exposure to a stimulating environment, can wield a profound impact on their future trajectory. Conversely, if children are raised in a detrimental family environment, they may assimilate negative traits that could manifest as inappropriate behavior later in life.\nOn the other hand, proponents of experiences during the teenage years also emphasize their pivotal role in shaping a person's future. They argue that interactions a teenager initiates with individuals beyond their immediate family, such as friends and teachers, significantly contribute to their growth into adulthood. Indeed, as teenagers begin to make independent decisions in their daily lives and face the consequences of those decisions, they acquire valuable life lessons that influence their behavior and thought patterns. Consequently, this phase serves as a milestone, laying a firm foundation for comprehensive development during adolescence.\nIn conclusion, I personally endorse the viewpoint that experiences acquired at school carry substantial influence, as they enable children to learn appropriate social behavior within this specific environment.\n"

This essay strongly disagrees with that notion because the main purpose of ads should be to inform their target audience about a variety of services. Attempting to persuade people to purchase unnecessary products is likely to lead to failure.\nFirst and foremost, being informed about a product that one genuinely needs is the key motivation for meaningful shopping. Therefore, advertising companies should identify their target audience and provide them with information about different types of goods and services that cater to their needs, rather than trying to attract them randomly. For example, a language learning application called LinQ promoted its service to language learners on YouTube and doubled its revenue in just one month.\nFurthermore, it is an undeniable fact that customers are becoming increasingly discerning, which makes it challenging to entice them into buying unnecessary items. Since consumers often have limited budgets, they tend to be more cautious when making purchases. This is why companies that employ the strategy of selling to a broad audience without specific targeting are likely to experience a decline in revenue. For instance, a well-known enterprise called BlueX experienced a 30% decrease in income due to disregarding the results of preference surveys.\nIn conclusion, while some argue that the primary goal of advertising is to boost the sales of less desirable products, I firmly believe that this strategy is detrimental to businesses.

This seems impractical because they have various other essential expenses to cover, such as food, housing, children's tuition fees, and healthcare. Furthermore, petrol-powered vehicles emit carbon dioxide, contributing to adverse environmental consequences. Scientific studies confirm that the environmental pollution resulting from CO2 emissions from petrol is responsible for the greenhouse effect, ozone layer depletion, and melting of polar ice caps. Hence, increasing petrol prices emerges as a reasonably effective strategy to address these pressing issues.\nNevertheless, there exist more optimal solutions to comprehensively alleviate these problems without resorting to higher petrol prices. In each country, the escalation of fuel prices, particularly petrol, could trigger inflation and exert a substantial impact on the national economy. Instead of relying on petrol-powered transportation, we could promote the use of electric vehicles, a move strongly advocated by the government. For instance, in Vietnam, the Vinfast electric vehicle system has been fully deployed in Ha Noi, garnering significant support from the public. Additionally, embracing alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles or even walking, represents a practical and eco-friendly approach. These alternatives not only contribute to improved health but also result in substantial cost savings while simultaneously preserving the environment.\nIn conclusion, while raising petrol prices to limit people's commuting is one potential approach, it is not the most optimal solution when compared to the alternatives I have mentioned above. Governments should consider more proactive interventions to comprehensively address these complex issues.\n"

      "question": "What are the positive and negative impacts of technology on our lives?",
      "paragraph": "In the age of technology, we have witnessed significant changes in the ways people connect and interact with each other. Undoubtedly, technology exerts a profound influence on our daily lives across various dimensions. From my perspective, technology brings about both positive and negative developments that impact our lives as a whole.\nPresently, the advent of the technological era known as 4.0 has had a massive impact on education, business, and society at large. To begin with, the internet, in conjunction with smartphones, has greatly enhanced distance learning. Students now have the opportunity to study remotely instead of attending school daily, and they can also revisit these lessons to prepare for exams or review their knowledge at their convenience. Furthermore, businesses can conduct meetings remotely without the need to travel to partner countries. Undoubtedly, technology aids companies in saving time and money while maintaining an efficient work pace. Last but not least, the integration of technology appears to be a significant step forward for society. Thanks to these smart devices, work progress has accelerated compared to the past, and we no longer require as much manual labor.\nNevertheless, despite the leaps technology has taken, it still carries some negative impacts alongside its positive influences. On the one hand, technology provides greater convenience and utility for people. The emergence of smart and entertainment apps like Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, or Telegram enriches our experiences, allowing us to unwind and relieve stress after long hours of work. Additionally, tools such as Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, or Zoom play a vital role in assisting companies and businesses in their operations. On the other hand, technology also has its downsides, leading to detrimental effects on users. Recent research by scientists indicates a significant rise in the percentage of young adults addicted to smartphones and other intelligent devices. Moreover, many individuals excessively rely on modern technology, often to the point of dependence. Consequently, they are hesitant to engage in face-to-face interactions with people around them, and some even prefer making friends online through social platforms rather than connecting with friends in real life.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that technology has brought about advancements and benefits. However, it is important for users to exercise caution and consideration when utilizing it in their daily lives, as it also carries certain disadvantages.\n"

      "paragraph": "It is evident that rules and laws play a crucial role in today's society. While some argue that individuals should have the freedom to do as they please, I strongly believe that without responsibility for their actions, the consequences would be disastrous.\nFrom my perspective, regulations are highly essential for building a sustainable society. Firstly, the concept of crime would cease to exist without punishments to act as a deterrent. This absence of consequences would likely encourage people to engage in illegal activities since they would not be compelled to follow any set of rules. For example, when someone neglects to pay their taxes, the law mandates that they face consequences and pay the additional fees. Consequently, a sense of justice is instilled within them, discouraging future violations. This, in turn, ensures that the government has a sufficient budget to maintain the activities of society.\nFurthermore, it is an undeniable fact that compliance with rules established by authorities is closely tied to the safety and well-being of humanity as a whole. If behaviors were left unregulated, a nation would descend into chaos, and its economy would crumble. To illustrate, when people disregard traffic regulations, accidents and congestion increase. This negatively impacts the revenue of numerous businesses as their products cannot be efficiently delivered. Similarly, in a country lacking regulations to penalize online merchants selling counterfeit products, consumers would lose trust in internet shopping, leading to economic problems.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that a population can only thrive and be well-managed when rules and laws are in place to set boundaries on individual freedom.\n"

      "question": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of strict and lenient parenting styles?",
      "paragraph": "Child-rearing plays a pivotal role in shaping a child's inherent traits. There are two primary styles of parenting: lenient and strict. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages, which I will explore in this essay.\nOn the one hand, strict parenting can positively influence children in several ways. Firstly, it encourages them to establish self-discipline. Disciplinarian parents establish clear rules and goals for their children, creating a structured environment that helps develop crucial self-control skills. This skill is vital in various aspects of life. Secondly, strict parents provide a safer environment by closely monitoring their children's activities, relationships, and social interactions. This high level of supervision shields children from potential dangers and negative friendships. It also helps parents set clear boundaries and limitations, enabling children to make informed choices and understand the consequences of their actions.\nHowever, being raised by strict parents can also have detrimental effects on a child's development. To begin with, children under strict parenting may lack autonomy. The extensive rules imposed by strict parents can limit a child's ability to make decisions for themselves, hindering the development of independence and creativity. Consequently, children may struggle to build problem-solving and decision-making skills later in life. Additionally, strict parents often require children to act without expressing their own emotions freely, which can lead to emotional repression. This difficulty in identifying and managing emotions can result in aggression and even physical cruelty towards others.\nOn the other hand, lenient parenting allows children to gain a deeper understanding of themselves. Firstly, it fosters problem-solving skills. Lenient parents, typically open-minded individuals, encourage open communication and provide opportunities for children to explore their curiosity and express their thoughts and ideas. This nurtures critical thinking and logical decision-making skills, helping children become more independent problem solvers. Additionally, lenient parents focus on their children's emotions, creating a space for them to express and process their feelings. This nurturing environment promotes emotional intelligence, enabling children to better understand and manage their emotions in social interactions.\nHowever, excessive leniency can have adverse effects on children. First, it can lead to a sense of entitlement. When children are excessively indulged, they may develop a belief that they are exempt from rules and deserve special treatment. This can result in entitled behavior in the future. Second, children of lenient parents may lack self-discipline and motivation. Without clear rules to follow and an understanding of the importance of setting goals and working hard, they may struggle to harness their abilities and hinder their personal achievements.\nIn conclusion, both strict and lenient parenting styles have their merits and demerits. It is essential for parents to strike a balance between these approaches to create an effective parenting style that best serves the development and well-being of their children.\n"

Personally, I strongly agree with the idea that parents play a pivotal role in this regard.\nOn one hand, schools primarily impart academic knowledge in subjects like Mathematics, Literature, and Geography. However, this knowledge alone is insufficient for molding children into good citizens. Beyond academics, youngsters need to develop soft skills such as effective communication, independence, and problem-solving abilities. Unfortunately, schools often lack the necessary resources and dedicated educators to instill these vital skills in students. Moreover, with the increasing prevalence of distance learning worldwide, students are missing out on the valuable in-person interactions with peers and teachers that contribute to their flexibility and vitality.\nOn the other hand, being a model citizen encompasses not only academic prowess but also good moral values. I firmly believe that parents are well-suited to guide their children in developing these moral virtues. From the moment a child is born, they are closely connected to their parents, creating a strong bond. This bond provides parents with countless opportunities to impart values and manners to their children as they grow. Many people agree that a child raised with love and careful guidance is more likely to become a responsible and upstanding member of society. It is crucial for parents who choose to become caregivers to have a comprehensive understanding of child-rearing, as this forms the foundation for nurturing responsible citizens.\nIn conclusion, the task of nurturing children into moral citizens is of utmost importance for every society.

In this regard, parents are uniquely positioned to guide their children in developing these virtues. From the moment a child is born, there exists a profound bond between parents and their offspring, making parents indispensable in shaping their children's future. Each day presents opportunities for parents to instill values, manners, and a sense of responsibility in their children.

Some argue that foreign tourists should pay higher fees than local visitors when exploring cultural and historical sites. Although foreign visitors often have a stronger financial position, it is not advisable to exploit them in order to develop our tourist attractions, as this could harm our economy. From my perspective, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint, as I will explain in this essay.\nFirst and foremost, foreigners can introduce local cultures to their international friends during their stay in our country. For instance, in my homeland, research shows that more than 60% of outbound travelers engage in exploring historical sites based on reviews and videos shared by previous visitors. These attractions contribute to making our destinations more authentic and appealing to those who wish to immerse themselves in a new culture. If we increase fees solely for foreign visitors, it could discourage their interest in traveling and dissuade them from returning for future visits due to the higher costs involved. Another vital point to consider is that international visitors can help us expand our services, thus boosting the economy.\nAn increase in the number of visitors leads to the diversification of local activities aimed at attracting them. For instance, in the highlands of Vietnam, ethnic minorities used to keep their villages off-limits to outsiders, but in recent years, a multitude of people have flocked to enjoy various festivities. Through these serene and scenic experiences, more visitors are enticed to join in the celebrations, ultimately contributing to the steady growth of our service-based economy without the need to extract additional funds from them. Therefore, by maintaining uniform fees for all attractions worldwide, we not only open up opportunities to stimulate the current economic climate but also preserve our historical sites.\nIn conclusion, it is essential to develop attractions for all visitors while preserving our cultural and historical heritage.

While traditional print media continues to hold significance in our daily lives, I respectfully disagree that it remains the utmost essential source for staying updated with the latest news.\nThere are several compelling reasons why newspapers remain a vital source of information in this digital era. Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that not everyone has the opportunity to access online news. Specifically, individuals residing in remote areas may lack internet connectivity or the necessary technological devices such as smartphones, computers, or tablets to access online websites. Moreover, many individuals, especially the elderly, have a deep-seated preference for the tangible experience of reading a physical newspaper. Lastly, newspapers offer a level of reliability and trustworthiness that comes from being scrutinized by journalists and authorities before reaching the public.\nNevertheless, online newspapers are poised to become increasingly popular and may even surpass their traditional counterparts in the future. One significant advantage is the speed and breadth of news access they offer from around the world. With a smartphone connected to the internet, people can easily access the latest news across various domains without the need to purchase individual newspapers. Furthermore, reading news online contributes to environmental conservation by reducing the need for paper, as thousands of trees are cut down annually to produce paper for the printing industry.\nIn conclusion, despite the enduring importance of traditional newspapers as a source of information, I believe that online news will progressively integrate into our daily lives in the future.

      "paragraph": "In some countries, classical music concerts and plays are not very popular among young people. This essay aims to explore the reasons behind this trend and argue for why it is important to encourage young individuals to attend classical music events.\nThe decline in young people's attendance at classical music concerts can be attributed to several factors, with one of the most prominent being their preference for other music genres. This can be explained by the fact that contemporary music styles often feature catchy lyrics and rhythms that are more appealing to the youth, making it easier to capture their attention. Another significant reason is the perceived complexity of classical music, which requires a certain level of understanding to fully appreciate. This complexity can make classical music less attractive to young audiences compared to other music genres. For example, recent shows by popular groups like Blackpink have attracted a large number of young people worldwide due to their versatility in depicting contemporary reality.\nDespite these challenges, it is crucial to advocate for young people's participation in classical concerts. This not only contributes to the preservation and development of cultural heritage but also enriches and diversifies the local culture for future generations. Moreover, scientific research has shown that classical music can enhance cognitive function in the brain and increase dopamine production, often referred to as the \"happiness chemical.\" When these two factors work together, they can help prevent cognitive decline and enhance individual intelligence.\nIn conclusion, although it may be challenging for young people to engage with classical music due to its demands on personal understanding, it is essential to encourage them to attend classical concerts and plays.

In my view, this issue is primarily caused by the intense competitiveness of the job market, and there are several measures that can be taken to address it effectively.\nIn today's world, the job market is fiercely competitive, affecting both young and older individuals. Securing and maintaining employment has become increasingly challenging, even for managers and senior officers. Employees face the constant risk of being terminated unless they consistently demonstrate high productivity and dedication, especially during economic recessions. Consequently, a significant number of workers opt to work overtime, resulting in reduced time for leisure activities and family. In essence, the intense competition for jobs is the fundamental reason behind the imbalance between work and personal life.\nTo tackle this challenging problem, several solutions can be considered. Firstly, authorities should encourage companies to adopt policies like the 6-hour workday or 4-day workweek. Reduced working hours would enable employees to allocate more time to their hobbies and family, ultimately enhancing their overall well-being. This, in turn, can lead to a substantial increase in productivity and efficiency. Another viable solution is for individuals to improve their work efficiency.

      "question": "What are the most significant advancements that humanity has made in the past century, and what areas still require improvement?",
      "paragraph": "One hundred years ago, some people held firm beliefs that the human race would continually advance in every facet of life. Nowadays, however, people are less certain about this notion. In which domains do you believe the most crucial advancements have been realized? In which areas do you think there is still much work to be done?\nOn the positive side, humanity has made remarkable strides in the fields of medicine and technology. To begin with, the field of medicine has witnessed substantial growth. Notably, advancements in medical technology have resulted in a significant increase in life expectancy. For instance, innovative inventions have emerged for the early detection of serious diseases like HIV, providing individuals with a greater opportunity to live longer and healthier lives than in previous generations. Additionally, communication hurdles that once existed over vast distances have been effectively addressed. In the present day, people can work and connect with others through online platforms such as Facebook or Meet, enhancing our lives in numerous positive ways.\nHowever, every coin has two sides, and there are still areas that require improvement. Firstly, in our pursuit of a higher quality of life, some essential values such as honesty and respect for the elderly, cherished by our forebears, seem to have been forgotten. While we excel in imparting scientific knowledge, we sometimes neglect to instill moral values that are essential for the preservation of our humanity. A poignant illustration of this is the tragic nuclear bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Furthermore, modern society exerts tremendous pressure on individuals to keep pace with the fast-paced contemporary world. For example, the rising costs of housing in urban areas place substantial strain on residents, particularly those grappling with financial hardships.\nIn conclusion, although the human race has made remarkable progress in numerous areas, these achievements often come with unintended consequences. It is incumbent upon all of us to take action and address these issues in order to create a better world for future generations.\n"

      "question": "Should government spending on wildlife preservation be prioritized over other areas that benefit humanity?",
      "paragraph": "It is undeniable that government spending has a considerable impact on a country's wildlife preservation. However, some argue that more state funding should be directed towards areas that benefit humanity instead of protecting wild animals. I completely agree with this perspective, emphasizing the significance of investing in human life.\nIt is understandable why some individuals advocate for increased financial attention to wild animals. The main reason behind this is that animals contribute significantly to the field of medicine. To be more specific, the development of new drugs and treatments heavily relies on wildlife and their habitats. Many modern remedies contain ingredients derived from wild animals. For instance, frogs serve as a notable example; they may one day be a source of remarkable medicines. Researchers in Australia, Japan, and the United States have discovered various medical applications for compounds extracted from frog secretions, such as a non-addictive painkiller and a natural adhesive that could replace stitches after surgery. Another argument supporting this view is that the extinction of wild species continues unabated. Indeed, human activities like deforestation and waste have destroyed natural wildlife habitats, pushing some species to the brink of extinction. Despite numerous conservation programs, the number of endangered animals continues to rise, indicating insufficient focus on their protection.\nHowever, despite the aforementioned arguments favoring the emphasis on wildlife protection, the human population should not be overlooked. Firstly, it is an exaggeration to claim that the extinction of any species leads to a disaster. Wildlife conservationists argue that ecosystems would be seriously affected if any animals are on the verge of extinction, but this may be overstated. The case of dinosaurs illustrates this situation well. Fossil evidence shows that the mass extinction of dinosaurs did not harm other species; in fact, it contributed to the evolution and emergence of other mammals. Another consideration is that human beings are confronting more urgent issues, such as climate change and fatal diseases. Increasing funding for wildlife preservation often translates to reduced resources allocated to vital areas of human life. Therefore, financial attention should be directed toward medical research, particularly in finding cures for deadly diseases like HIV and cancer, which can save thousands of lives in society.\nIn conclusion, although there are compelling arguments for allocating excess financial attention to wildlife conservation, I believe that a greater focus should be placed on human life, addressing immediate threats like epidemics and poverty.\n"

      "question": "Shared responsibility for environmental preservation: The government vs. individuals",
      "paragraph": "In contemporary society, due to humanity's relentless pursuit of economic development, climate change has been increasingly exacerbated. However, there are differing views on who should be responsible for environmental preservation. Some argue that it is primarily the government's duty, while others believe that the conservation of natural habitats rests with each individual. In this essay, I will discuss the rationale behind both perspectives before explaining why I lean towards the latter view.\nOn the one hand, it is widely acknowledged that the government plays a significant role in ensuring the safety and health of the environment. Firstly, governments should enact environmental legislation to enhance the quality of the natural environment. For example, strict penalties should be imposed on companies emitting excessive amounts of CO2 in industrial areas, including the revocation of their licenses and hefty taxation for unsustainable business practices. Moreover, individuals who violate these laws should face severe consequences such as community service, fines, or even imprisonment. Singapore provides a compelling example of this approach, where individuals caught littering in public places can be fined up to $200.\nOn the other hand, it is undeniable that every individual can make a substantial contribution to mitigating environmental problems. One key solution is to raise awareness among residents about environmental protection and encourage them to adopt a greener lifestyle, including practices like recycling, sorting waste, and using public transportation. It is believed that through these small, daily actions, individuals can significantly improve environmental quality and reduce its deterioration. Another crucial measure is for individuals to avoid impulsive consumption. The excessive production of low-priced goods to meet consumer demand leads to a significant amount of waste, which ends up in landfills, harming the soil.\nIn conclusion, while government actions, such as enacting laws and imposing severe penalties for violators, are essential, the human factor is equally crucial for long-term effective environmental measures. Therefore, it is necessary to combine the efforts of both the government and individuals to protect the environment comprehensively and effectively.\n"

While some individuals argue that everyone should possess the freedom to partake in these sports, I hold the view that authorities should prohibit these risky activities for several reasons.\nOn one hand, there is an argument that banning dangerous sports infringes upon people's personal freedom. While some argue that engaging in such activities is reckless, others derive significant fulfillment and personal growth from specific extreme sports. There have been numerous instances where athletes who had previously struggled with substance abuse, such as alcohol and drugs, found an outlet for their energy through these sports. By dedicating themselves to honing their skills and training for high-risk activities, their lives have improved.\nOn the other hand, extreme sports not only endanger the participants but also pose risks to innocent and young individuals. Nowadays, social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube are flooded with videos of people engaging in these perilous activities. These videos can exert a highly negative influence, especially on young people who yearn for adventure and may end up harming themselves and others. Furthermore, certain sports like boxing involve violence, which can stimulate aggressive thoughts in the audience and potentially lead to bullying and violent behavior, especially among school-aged students.\nIn conclusion, despite individuals' right to make their own choices, I am of the opinion that the government should impose restrictions on extreme sports and encourage greater personal responsibility.\n"

      "paragraph": "Wildlife conservation is a significant concern that demands our attention. Some argue that it is our duty to protect all wild creatures, while others contend that we should focus on preserving only a select few. In this essay, we will examine these two perspectives in detail and then conclude.\nOne of the primary arguments against conserving all wild animals is related to safety. Some believe that wild creatures pose a threat to human existence. For example, carnivorous animals like tigers have the potential to harm humans in their quest for food. Consequently, proponents of this viewpoint argue that not all wild animals should be conserved. Another rationale for this stance is the allocation of resources. They argue that rather than investing in the preservation of animals, government budgets should prioritize areas such as education and healthcare. It is worth noting that a significant portion of the global population still struggles with hunger and life-threatening diseases. Therefore, these funds should be directed towards addressing these pressing human needs, rather than being spent on wildlife conservation.\nOn the other hand, many argue that humans are responsible for the destruction of wildlife populations. Consequently, they believe that we have a duty to protect them. Moreover, if we only conserve a select few animals, the balance of our planet's ecosystem could be disrupted, leading to disastrous consequences for the environment. Additionally, many medical treatments and remedies have been developed through testing on animals, ensuring the safety of humans. This underscores the importance of protecting the existence of wild animals.\nIn conclusion, I believe that it is our responsibility to protect as many wild animals as possible. Governments should allocate sufficient funds to safeguard the world's wildlife, in addition to addressing major human challenges. This approach not only ensures the well-being of our ecosystem but also contributes to improved living standards and overall well-being for people.\n"

In my perspective, individuals should acquire knowledge that directly enhances their work-related skills rather than focusing solely on academic courses.\nOn one hand, there exist several rationales for opting for university education. Firstly, having a university degree often leads to better employment prospects. Many companies now view a degree as a standard criterion for admitting and selecting employees. Naturally, possessing a university degree increases one's chances of securing positions in prominent corporations. To illustrate, in Vietnam, obtaining employment with a major company typically necessitates a university degree along with certain certifications. Additionally, university programs encompass managerial subjects, paving the way for potential leadership roles in the future.\nConversely, there are compelling reasons to endorse vocational training. Foremost among them is the relatively shorter duration of study. As far as I am aware, vocational courses typically span approximately two years, or even less in the case of certain online programs. Furthermore, upon completing vocational training, individuals can swiftly secure jobs that align with their skills and preferences. Perhaps the most convincing aspect is the partnerships between vocational schools and various companies, facilitating job placement for graduates.\nIn summary, I contend that it is advantageous for students to engage in vocational training, as it expedites their ability to secure suitable employment opportunities in a rapidly evolving global job market.\n"

      "paragraph": "There are numerous national and international celebrations throughout the year that have become heavily commercialized, with shops and companies seizing the opportunity to maximize their profits. Extensive advertising campaigns, which commence well in advance of the celebration itself, often lead to some individuals paying minimal attention to the original significance of the event.\nIn the subsequent essay, I will discuss some of the issues arising from this commercialization and propose potential remedies.\nOne of the primary problems associated with celebrations excessively focused on expenditure is that it can induce stress and unhappiness in some individuals. This stress may stem from concerns about selecting appropriate gifts or, in some cases, from financial constraints that prevent them from purchasing presents.\nArguably, the most significant issue is the erosion of the true essence of these celebrations. Most festivities are intended to foster appreciation for life and the opportunity to spend quality time with friends and family. Unfortunately, due to the overwhelming emphasis on material gifts and monetary transactions, these fundamental values are frequently overshadowed, sometimes even leading to disputes among loved ones.\nI firmly believe that the solutions to these problems are straightforward. Firstly, it is the responsibility of both schools and parents to impart the younger generation with a comprehensive understanding of the authentic meaning behind each celebration. Secondly, and perhaps more crucially, people should consider limiting the number of gifts exchanged, thereby reducing the undue emphasis placed on material aspects of the occasion.\nIn conclusion, celebrations that have strayed too far from their original purpose and are fixated on extravagant spending can have adverse effects, causing stress and unhappiness for some. To avert these consequences in the future, it is imperative to educate the younger generation about the genuine significance of these occasions, and society as a whole should shift its focus away from the exchange of gifts.\n"

In my opinion, I agree that introducing foreign language education in primary school holds more benefits than drawbacks.\nOn the one hand, initiating foreign language learning at an early age can occasionally lead to stress among young learners. To clarify, primary students are newcomers to the educational environment, and they are not accustomed to the academic demands of school. Consequently, some students may become overwhelmed when confronted with both their regular subjects and the addition of a foreign language. For example, in Vietnam, particularly in International Schools, children are required to study subjects in English alongside their standard curriculum. Consequently, they often experience anxiety, potentially negatively impacting their childhood experiences due to the constant pressure of their studies.\nIn contrast, learning a foreign language during primary school can yield long-term benefits for many children. For instance, by introducing foreign language education early in their academic journey, they gain more opportunities to grasp knowledge that might be challenging for older students. As a result, they may acquire proficiency in the foreign language more rapidly compared to their peers. Furthermore, developing strong foreign language skills can enhance their future career prospects, opening doors to better job opportunities in more favorable work environments.\nTo sum up, introducing foreign language learning can have both positive and negative consequences.

I partially concur with this notion because legal penalties can act as an incentive for residents, yet it is equally crucial to nurture a sense of social responsibility in them.\nTo commence, penalties can indeed function as a motivator for citizens to engage in recycling practices. Consider financial penalties, for instance; if individuals fail to recycle their household waste, they would be required to pay a specified fine. This financial consequence can instill a fear in residents that their money could be unexpectedly drained from their pockets. Consequently, people might comply with the regulations and recycle their waste to evade legal repercussions, thereby contributing to an increase in the quantity of recycled waste.\nNonetheless, it is also vital to focus on promoting a sense of social responsibility. When it comes to laws, it is practically impossible to compile a comprehensive list of individuals who do not adhere to waste recycling in their homes and penalize each one of them. Consequently, governments may not be able to rely solely on legal measures to boost recycling in all cases. Conversely, nurturing a sense of responsibility can instill a lifelong motivation to safeguard the environment through waste recycling, as it stems from an individual's inherent personality and awareness. Governments can underscore the significance of environmental protection and the substantial impact of recycling on our daily lives through various social media platforms like Instagram. This widespread exposure can significantly raise citizens' awareness and encourage them to take responsibility for their actions.\nIn conclusion, the recycling of household waste is currently inadequate, and the proposition that laws are the sole solution to address this issue is only partially agreeable. Legal mandates can indeed serve as a means to motivate individuals to recycle; however, it is equally important to instill a sense of social responsibility in residents.\n"

I concur with the viewpoint that it has indeed increased complexity and pressure in people's lives.\nUndoubtedly, social networking has introduced numerous opportunities to enhance the flexibility and modernization of our lives. However, it has also exposed individuals to various risks, such as cyberbullying. This is a critical concern because an increasing number of people are experiencing insults and having their personal information stolen, leading to severe consequences like suicide and self-harm. Moreover, these negative experiences can lead to discouragement and ultimately result in depression, which can adversely impact social skills and mental well-being. Despite efforts to stay up-to-date and impose stricter terms on users, this issue continues to escalate and remains challenging to control.\nAnother contentious issue is the potential for fake news to mislead and provoke unwarranted reactions from individuals. While contemporary news provides real-time updates, it carries inherent risks. Some news articles are written with the intent to manipulate people's thoughts or deceive them, causing confusion and putting individuals at risk of being influenced by misleading information.

In my view, while prevention is undoubtedly important, I believe that investing in treatment and cures is equally crucial.\nOn one hand, directing public funding toward promoting a healthy lifestyle can bring significant benefits. This approach can help individuals realize the importance of maintaining good health and encourage them to become health-conscious. For instance, authorities can launch large-scale health campaigns to remind the public of the importance of regular exercise and healthy eating choices. Furthermore, government bodies can invest in building and improving sports and recreational facilities such as gyms, parks, or stadiums to create opportunities for people to engage in physical activities. This promotes an active lifestyle among the public, potentially reducing the prevalence of diseases like obesity and cardiovascular conditions.\nOn the other hand, providing public funding for the treatment of diseases is also of paramount importance. Without adequate funding for improving treatments and medications, the lives of patients, especially those in critical conditions, could be at risk. For example, individuals diagnosed with diseases like cancer or HIV require specialized treatment and high-quality medications to save their lives. Another prime example is the case of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2021, the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic left thousands of patients in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in critical health conditions. The lack of essential healthcare facilities, technologies, and medications partly contributed to the loss of many lives among Covid-19 patients. These examples underscore the importance of enhancing the quality of treatment to ensure that patients can recover from illnesses and diseases.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the government should allocate equal subsidies for promoting a healthy lifestyle and treating illnesses to ensure that their citizens can lead healthy, productive, and prosperous lives.

This essay aims to pinpoint the primary issues resulting from this phenomenon and propose potential solutions to alleviate its negative consequences.\nAs individuals enjoy longer lifespans and the populations of advanced nations age, several interrelated problems become evident. Firstly, an aging populace implies a larger number of retirees eligible for pensions. Consequently, there could be a significant decline in the proportion of younger, working adults, leading to reduced tax revenue for governments in relation to the population size. This, in turn, may necessitate higher tax burdens on the working population to maintain economic stability. Secondly, increased longevity may also generate greater demand for healthcare services, potentially diverting the time and energy of younger individuals away from their leisure pursuits to care for their elderly family members.\nThere exist several strategies that governments can adopt to mitigate the aforementioned challenges. Initially, authorities can consider raising the retirement age for working adults, possibly from 65 to 70. This adjustment is rooted in the fact that individuals in this age group often possess good health and can continue to contribute productively to the workforce, thanks to advancements in medical research. For example, in Japan, many people continue working well into their 80s, demonstrating their capacity to perform as effectively as younger counterparts. Another viable approach is for governments to promote immigration to augment the number of working adults who contribute to the tax base. Germany, for instance, has successfully attracted millions of immigrants annually, bolstering its labor force and thereby fostering economic growth.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that in developed countries, populations are progressively aging, giving rise to significant challenges.

In my view, I partly agree with this perspective, and I'll explain my stance with several reasons.\nThe role of schools in society is indeed unique, as they not only provide knowledge but also assess students' learning abilities through examinations. This analysis and exploration of academic theories are essential for determining students' academic success, which, in turn, serves as the foundation for gaining entry into higher education institutions. Furthermore, the academic programs offered by schools enable students to gain a deeper understanding of various subjects, helping them identify their strengths and choose suitable career paths. For instance, in China, high schools are divided into two departments: social science and natural science. Thanks to this broad-based education, students acquire a wide range of knowledge, enabling them to study effectively and achieve excellent results, thereby establishing a solid foundation for higher education. Consequently, without the guidance of schools in academic theory and the opportunity to take standardized examinations, students may struggle to make informed choices about their future careers.\nHowever, it is important to recognize that practical skills hold equal significance alongside academic knowledge. Proficiencies in cookery, dressmaking, and woodwork are essential for individuals seeking to lead a high-quality life. The mastery of these practical skills enhances one's overall quality of life. For example, students who venture abroad need to possess competent cooking skills to manage their living expenses efficiently and improve the quality of their daily meals. Furthermore, in today's educational landscape, top-tier institutions seek students who excel not only academically but also in practical skills. Harvard University, for instance, tends to favor applicants who demonstrate impressive extracurricular activities and practical skills over those who focus solely on academic theories from textbooks.\nIn conclusion, my perspective diverges from the notion that students should exclusively prioritize academic learning.

      "question": "Are video records a better way to learn about global lifestyles than written documents?",
      "paragraph": "It is argued that video records are a better way to learn about global lifestyles rather than written documents. There is indeed a strong case to be made for both sides of the debate, which will be discussed now.\nOn the one hand, there are many reasons why video is more effective than documents. Firstly, direct videos capture more interesting and vivid images. To be specific, video recording gives us realistic images, specific sounds, colors, and human emotions that text cannot express. For example, during Tet, the video shows us the excitement of the Tet atmosphere, the bustling sounds, and the bright colors of clothes, decorations, and candies, thereby making it easy for people, especially foreigners who want to learn about Vietnam, to find it more interesting than with lengthy texts. Moreover, people who read written documents to learn about the Lunar New Year might not feel the festival atmosphere. It is also very challenging for people to imagine some traditional culture without watching it.\nHowever, video recording still has certain limitations. First of all, documents such as books, magazines, and newspapers are reliable sources of information. In particular, those that are published go through strict censorship steps to ensure that all information is accurate, much more so than uncensored videos. There is still a risk of misinformation causing viewers to have distorted thoughts. Moreover, video wasn't possible in an era without cameras, so books are the only things that help history buffs and archaeologists find things from the past. For instance, if you want to know about the Nguyen dynasty, you can definitely only find them through historical texts.\n"

      "question": "Why are classical music concerts and plays failing to capture the interest of young people?",
      "paragraph": "It is a well-known fact that classical music concerts and plays often fail to capture the interest of young people in many countries. This essay will delve into some of the primary reasons for this phenomenon and propose solutions to address it.\nThe decline in the attendance of classical music concerts and plays by young individuals can be attributed to a variety of factors. Foremost among these is the preference of young audiences for other genres of music, such as pop and hip-hop, largely due to advancements in technology. These contemporary music styles often feature catchy lyrics and rhythms that appeal to the youth, drawing a significant following. Another significant factor is the perceived complexity of classical music, which demands a certain level of understanding to fully appreciate, making it less attractive to young audiences compared to other genres. For instance, a recent Blackpink concert attracted a large number of young attendees due to its clear and relatable lyrics.\nDespite these challenges, it is imperative that we encourage young people to attend classical music concerts and performances. Firstly, supporting classical arts among the youth can contribute to the preservation of cultural heritage. This ensures that traditional art forms continue to thrive, enriching the local culture for generations to come. Additionally, research indicates that exposure to classical music can enhance personal intelligence and concentration, thanks to its positive influence. For instance, studies have shown that children whose mothers played Mozart's music tended to solve puzzles more effectively.\nIn conclusion, although classical music concerts and plays may initially pose challenges for young audiences due to their unfamiliarity and personal preferences, it is essential to promote their attendance. Doing so not only benefits their cognitive development but also plays a crucial role in preserving our cultural heritage.\n"

      "paragraph": "These days, many cities are addressing their housing needs through the construction of high-rise buildings, while others opt for building houses on a larger expanse of land. I tend to agree with the former approach because it conserves land and has a more positive impact on the environment.\nFirstly, opting for taller buildings for residents consumes less land compared to constructing houses over a wide horizontal space. This is primarily because high-rise structures grow vertically, thus necessitating only a small land area for their construction. In contrast, the expansion of residential areas horizontally can result in the wastage of significant land resources, leaving insufficient space for other important endeavors such as establishing medical and educational facilities. Therefore, by expanding housing vertically, governments can conserve a substantial amount of land for critical projects.\nMoreover, this approach can lead to reduced environmental consequences. Since it saves a considerable land area, workers do not need to clear out obstacles that might obstruct their work. Conversely, when implementing the latter method, they may have to cut down trees and disrupt natural areas to accommodate these buildings. Trees play a crucial role in mitigating air pollution by absorbing CO2 and releasing oxygen. Therefore, removing them can have adverse effects on the urban environment. Consequently, it is widely believed that tall buildings are more environmentally beneficial. In the United States, for instance, this strategy has led to a significant improvement in air quality.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that expanding residential areas vertically is a superior choice to expanding horizontally because it requires less land and is more environmentally friendly.\n"

While I acknowledge the importance and benefits of a university degree, I wholeheartedly concur with the idea that we should promote the development of skilled workers, such as electricians and plumbers.\nThere are two compelling reasons why there is a growing demand for vocationally trained workers. Firstly, when constructing or renovating buildings, the presence of competent electricians, plumbers, and other tradespeople is indispensable. For instance, critical facilities in key sectors, including hospitals, schools, and museums, frequently require expansion or maintenance. Employing trained professionals for such tasks not only ensures the safety of these structures but also enhances the overall quality of life within the community. Secondly, some countries witness an oversaturation of university graduates in specific fields each year. Consequently, the rate of graduate unemployment experiences a significant annual increase. Therefore, it becomes imperative for these nations to prioritize the provision of additional vocational training opportunities.\nIt is imperative that more individuals are encouraged to participate in career-oriented courses and on-the-job training to address society's evolving needs. Educational institutions should not solely concentrate on exam-oriented curricula, which tend to be impractical and demotivating for students experiencing lower grades. As a result, schools must adapt their curriculum and offer workshops aimed at imparting practical skills. Parents, too, play a pivotal role by nurturing their children's unique talents and explaining the promising career prospects associated with vocational paths, thus inspiring them to consider such careers.\nIn conclusion, I firmly support the notion that encouraging greater participation in vocational training is crucial. This is because an increase in qualified workers who cater to society's demands leads to a more efficient and well-functioning society.\n"

In my view, the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages.\nOne significant benefit of studying abroad is that it fosters self-reliance among students. They must live independently, without the support of their parents, and often take on part-time jobs to cover their living expenses. This experience can enhance their self-esteem and confidence in facing life's challenges. Additionally, studying alongside classmates from different countries allows students to gain a deeper understanding of various cultures. Consequently, this exposure equips them with the skills to adapt quickly to international work environments.\nHowever, a drawback of this trend is the potential for students to experience mental challenges like culture shock and homesickness when studying overseas. If they struggle to integrate into the new environment, they may isolate themselves and even suffer from depression, negatively impacting their academic performance. Furthermore, choosing to pursue higher education in developed countries like the United States or Australia can place a significant financial burden on students' families. The high tuition fees and living expenses may require students to devote a considerable amount of time to part-time jobs, diverting their focus from their studies and leading to subpar academic performance.\nIn conclusion, the advantages of fostering self-reliance and developing the ability to adapt to international work environments appear to outweigh the disadvantages associated with potential issues like culture shock, homesickness, and financial strain on families.\n"

      "question": "What are the main causes of environmental degradation?",
      "paragraph": "It is widely recognized that environmental degradation poses a significant challenge for governments worldwide. This issue primarily arises from two key sources: industrialization and traffic emissions. In my view, addressing this problem requires implementing strict government regulations and increasing awareness among both residents and companies.\nThe underlying causes of declining environmental quality are clear. Firstly, the burning of fossil fuels to power industrial operations and the exhaust emissions from private vehicles contribute significantly to air pollution. Specifically, these activities release excessive amounts of carbon emissions into the atmosphere. This not only harms air quality in the short term but also has long-term consequences, leading to global warming and climate change. Another contributing factor is the rapid increase in population and improved living standards. As demand for goods rises, companies resort to mass production methods, resulting in shorter product lifecycles. Consequently, people use these products briefly before discarding them into bodies of water or landfills, leading to water and soil contamination.\nOn the other hand, I believe that several practical measures can be taken to mitigate environmental degradation. The primary recommendation is for governments to enact stringent environmental legislation aimed at improving the natural environment. This includes imposing heavy taxes on companies that engage in unsustainable practices. Additionally, those who violate these laws should face severe penalties, such as community service, fines, and even imprisonment. Their business licenses should also be revoked. Singapore serves as a notable example in this regard, where individuals caught littering in public places can be fined up to $200. Moreover, it is essential to compel businesses to invest in waste disposal treatment systems.\nAnother crucial solution is to raise awareness among citizens about adopting a more environmentally friendly lifestyle. This involves encouraging recycling, proper waste classification, and the use of public transportation. Individuals should also make an effort to avoid impulsive purchases, reducing the amount of waste entering our water and soil.\nIn conclusion, environmental degradation results from excessive emissions from factories and vehicles, as well as the waste generated by impulsive consumerism. Nevertheless, governments must take proactive steps, such as enacting legislation to ensure industrial sustainability, while individuals should be educated and encouraged to take responsibility for reducing environmental damage. These efforts are crucial in addressing this pressing issue.\n"

In this essay, I wholeheartedly agree with this perspective, primarily for the sake of ensuring the safety and quality of lessons for students.\nMy first argument is based on the idea that students might be at risk of injury when engaging in hands-on activities like experiments. Therefore, these tasks should be left to their teachers, who are inherently trained in the field. Given the students' lack of awareness about the potential dangers of experiments, they often lack the meticulousness of their teachers. Even a small mistake, such as adding a slightly larger quantity of a chemical element, can lead to undesirable situations, including explosions and fires, not to mention more significant errors. In such situations, students could potentially get burned or inhale toxic gases, posing a significant risk to their health, and in extreme cases, even leading to death. This illustrates the importance of minimizing these hazards by allowing experienced trainers to conduct experiments.\nAnother compelling reason involves the higher likelihood of teachers successfully performing experiments compared to students. Given that every chemical reaction or electrical experiment is by no means easy to carry out, inexperienced primary students are more likely to fail due to their lack of experience, which can hinder their understanding of the experimental effects. Conversely, when educators ensure correct results, students can gain a precise understanding of the subject matter that requires practical experimentation. This ultimately enhances students' learning experience and contributes positively to their academic performance.\nIn conclusion, due to the outstanding benefits it offers in terms of a safe learning environment and the acquisition of high-quality knowledge, I wholeheartedly agree with the viewpoint that primary school students should watch experiments carried out and demonstrated by their teachers rather than conducting experiments themselves.\n"

This essay will examine both perspectives before expressing my own opinion in favor of the former.\nOn one hand, it is understandable why some people believe that high school graduates should seek employment immediately after graduation. The primary reason supporting this view is that they can gain practical experience and start earning money right away, whereas those who opt for higher education typically spend another four years in college and incur substantial tuition fees. However, this reasoning has its flaws, as individuals who choose to pursue higher education and earn a college degree are likely to earn more than those with only a high school diploma. This is because they have undergone rigorous training in a specific field, acquiring greater academic knowledge and practical experience, giving them an advantage over their counterparts.\nOn the other hand, I align with the viewpoint that a well-educated workforce benefits both individuals and society as a whole. On an individual level, it is undeniable that one's level of education is directly related to their income. This can be attributed to the fact that those with a strong educational background are highly sought after by large companies and are more likely to secure well-paying jobs with numerous career prospects. On a larger scale, well-educated personnel tend to produce higher-quality and more durable products, leading to increased profits for companies. The implication of this is improved trade, which contributes to overall economic growth.\nIn conclusion, while the advantages of entering the workforce immediately after graduation are evident, I firmly believe that an intellectually and academically equipped workforce benefits both individuals and society as a whole.\n"

These edifices have stood the test of time, often bearing witness to significant events in the past. Preserving them can serve as a valuable repository of national culture and a tangible link to history. Furthermore, this can broaden the historical knowledge of children and younger generations, providing them with insights into their nation's history.

However, a school of thought holds that it is more beneficial for people to coexist with climate change instead of combating it. While this statement appears valid to a certain extent, I suppose that it could have some implications for both individuals and society in the long run.\nAdmittedly, living with climate change can bring some undeniable merits. First and foremost, the expenses allocated to climate change prevention are exorbitant. To be more specific, massive capital inflows into cutting-edge technologies, experts, and research centers put a burden on the national budget. As a result, there are inadequate budgets to spend on other urgent fields such as healthcare systems, defense, and education. Apart from that, most of us know that climate change is a natural phenomenon that humans are not strong enough to resist. The case of Japan, an Asian coastal country, can perfectly exemplify this situation. In fact, Japan is located in a special geographical position, in the Pacific earthquake belt and is frequently struck by earthquakes, while its complex coastline is vulnerable to tsunamis.\nNotwithstanding the aforementioned benefits of adapting to climate change, I believe that fighting against it would be more significant. The underlying reason is that the climate crisis is happening with high intensity and increasing complexity that human beings can't adapt to. In the sense that it is difficult for people to coexist when several natural disasters are occurring at the same time, such as global warming, floods, earthquakes, and so on. Another reason is that the effect of the climate crisis on plants and animals is devastating, and they find it difficult to adjust to rapidly changing environments. This is the culprit of the loss of animal habitats and even drives some wild animals to the verge of extinction. For example, the expansion of melting glaciers has been threatening the survival of polar bears in the North Pole. Thus, it is not possible for all living creatures on Earth to adjust to climate change.\nIn conclusion, although coexistence with climate shift is not without compelling arguments, I believe that finding a way to prevent it could be a more effective and long-term solution. Therefore, the proposal is that governments could introduce laws to limit carbon dioxide emissions that lead to global warming. As individuals, we should also try to limit our contribution to climate change by becoming more energy-efficient and using bicycles and public transport.\n"

I partially agree with this viewpoint. While I acknowledge that legal penalties can incentivize residents, I also believe that nurturing a sense of social responsibility is crucial.\nTo begin with, punitive measures can indeed motivate citizens to recycle their waste. Consider financial fines as an example. If individuals fail to recycle their household waste, they may face monetary penalties. This financial consequence can instill fear in residents, as they risk losing their hard-earned money unexpectedly. Consequently, people may adhere to recycling rules to avoid potential fines, resulting in an increase in the amount of waste being recycled.\nHowever, a more effective approach is to promote social responsibility. When it comes to enforcing laws, it is practically impossible to identify and penalize every individual who does not recycle their household waste. This limitation means that legal mandates alone may not be universally applicable to enhance recycling. In contrast, instilling a sense of responsibility can nurture a lasting motivation to protect the environment through recycling. This motivation stems from an individual's personality and awareness. Governments can emphasize the importance of environmental conservation and the significant impact of recycling on our lives through various social media platforms, such as Instagram. This widespread exposure can effectively raise citizens' awareness and encourage them to take responsibility for their actions concerning waste management.\nIn conclusion, the recycling of household waste falls short of the desired levels, and some argue that legal mandates are the only solution.

In this essay, I will explore both sides of this issue.\nThere are several reasons why people allocate significant funds and focus to their pets. Firstly, having pets can help individuals combat stress and loneliness, particularly those who live alone. This means there are various games and activities that people can engage in to have fun and keep their spirits up with their animal companions. For example, individuals can take their pets for a walk, which not only provides comfort to the owners but also helps them maintain good physical health. Secondly, pet ownership can instill a sense of responsibility in individuals. Owners must ensure they perform certain tasks for their pets on time. These tasks may include feeding and grooming. Consequently, pet owners may develop positive habits like punctuality.\nOn the other hand, there are those who argue that instead of dedicating excessive resources and attention to domestic animals, individuals should consider donating to assist those who are malnourished. Several reasons support this viewpoint. First and foremost, pets can have adverse effects on people's health. Some individuals are susceptible to infectious diseases that domestic animals can transmit. For instance, cat scratch disease can result in symptoms such as swelling, fever, and fatigue. Moreover, raising a pet can be risky for people who are allergic to fur or the odors associated with animals. Additionally, keeping pets can be financially burdensome.

Moreover, their outstanding achievements not only bring them recognition but also shine a spotlight on their teams, schools, cities, or countries.\nOn the other hand, numerous professions play pivotal roles in maintaining the smooth functioning of society. Doctors invest a minimum of ten years in demanding education and internships, ultimately saving lives. Teachers play a crucial role in educating and inspiring the next generation of responsible citizens. Social workers step in to assist individuals grappling with physical, mental, and psychological challenges, contributing to safer communities. However, despite their meaningful and essential contributions, professionals in these fields often struggle to make ends meet.\nIn my opinion, bestowing enormous salaries upon athletes is unnecessary. It is imperative to reconsider our societal priorities and bridge the substantial income gap among various professionals. By doing so, we can create societies in which every individual feels valued, appreciated, and adequately compensated for their respective vocations or areas of expertise.\n"

      "question": "What criteria should be used to determine which old buildings should be preserved?",
      "paragraph": "Preserving old buildings is a significant issue that many countries are grappling with today. Some people suggest that certain ancient buildings should receive special attention in terms of preservation. I wholeheartedly agree with this notion and believe that we should focus on those with historical and commercial significance. However, in general, the drawbacks of maintaining old buildings outweigh their benefits.\nWhen considering which types of old buildings deserve preservation, we should first prioritize those with historical value, such as churches, temples, and other similar structures. These buildings have stood the test of time for thousands of years, often being witnesses to significant events in the past. Preserving them can serve as a valuable source of information about a nation's culture and its historical journey. Additionally, young generations, especially children, can expand their knowledge of history and gain insights into their national heritage by exploring these historical sites.\nAnother category worth preserving is ancient structures that bear impressive architectural features. Each era is characterized by distinctive architectural designs. For example, the Renaissance period is renowned for its classical and solemn architectural constructions. Therefore, maintaining these buildings not only contributes to their cultural and aesthetic value but also promotes tourism.\nHowever, it's essential to acknowledge that preserving these buildings poses significant challenges. Firstly, restoring old buildings is a time-consuming and prohibitively expensive endeavor, often spanning months or even years and requiring a substantial portion of the government's budget. Moreover, the success rate of these restoration efforts is often disappointingly low, rendering the resources invested somewhat futile. Additionally, the preservation of too many old buildings can exacerbate issues of land scarcity, a problem that many countries are already facing. Our world is experiencing a dramatic increase in population, leading to a shortage of accommodation options. Therefore, holding onto these buildings in their entirety can worsen the situation.\nIn conclusion, not all ancient structures should be conserved in a country, except for those with historical and aesthetic significance. However, the preservation of these buildings should be carefully considered, as their drawbacks tend to outweigh their benefits.\n"

      "paragraph": "In developing nations, both students and employees exert significant effort in their respective pursuits, primarily due to financial constraints and the desire to create better prospects for the future. This phenomenon has more positive implications than negative ones.\nOne key reason some individuals work harder than others can be attributed to the substantial pressures they face in various aspects of their lives. These pressures emanate from both their domestic environments and workplaces, making it challenging to strike a harmonious balance. For instance, adults seeking marriage or women aspiring to have children often grapple with financial stress, compelling them to intensify their work efforts to accumulate sufficient wealth for future needs. Similarly, adolescents find themselves in similar predicaments, necessitating a greater focus on their studies.\nRegarding whether it is always advantageous to work diligently, I believe it is generally beneficial, but not without reservations. To elaborate, when individuals strive to complete their tasks efficiently and aim for higher productivity, they not only enhance their personal incomes but also contribute to the progress of their nation. Furthermore, within educational institutions and workplaces, the diligence of a few often inspires others to follow suit. People work harder with the hope of gaining recognition from their superiors and increasing their chances of career advancement. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that excessive hard work can have adverse effects on both physical and mental health, posing risks to individuals who consistently outpace their peers.\nIn conclusion, the inclination to work harder stems from the need for financial security and the pursuit of future opportunities. While hard work can yield substantial benefits, individuals must strike a balance between their workload and well-being to safeguard their health in the long run.\n"

      "paragraph": "It is a fact that classical music concerts and plays are not attracting many young people in numerous countries. This essay will examine some of the main reasons and suggest solutions to address the problem.\nThe decrease in youth attendance at classical music concerts and plays can be attributed to several factors. The primary reason is that young people tend to prefer other forms of music, such as pop and hip-hop, because of technological advancements. These genres often feature catchy lyrics and beats that appeal to their age group, which has a large fan base among the youth. Another significant factor is that classical music requires a certain level of knowledge to understand and appreciate, making it less appealing to young people compared to other genres. For example, a recent Blackpink concert attracted a large number of young attendees due to its clear lyrics and messages conveyed to the audience.\nDespite the aforementioned reasons, it is important to encourage young people to attend classical music concerts and performances. Firstly, supporting classical arts among the youth can help preserve cultural heritage. This ensures that traditional art forms continue to thrive, contributing to the diversity of local culture for future generations. Additionally, there is evidence that exposure to classical music can enhance personal intelligence and concentration, thanks to its positive influence. For instance, studies have shown that children whose mothers listened to Mozart's music tended to solve puzzles better.\nIn conclusion, although classical music concerts and plays may be challenging for young people to appreciate due to their lack of knowledge and personal preferences, it is important to encourage them to attend these events. Such experiences can be beneficial for their cognitive development and also play a role in preserving the nation's cultural heritage.\n"

      "paragraph": "It is believed that many individuals are dedicating a significant amount of attention and financial resources to their pet companions, while a considerable number of people worldwide are suffering from poverty. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives.\nThere are several reasons why a substantial amount of money is spent on and attention is given to domestic pets. Firstly, keeping pets can help individuals combat stress and loneliness, particularly those who live alone. In other words, there are various games and activities that people can engage in to entertain themselves and bond with their furry friends. For example, individuals can take their pets for walks, which not only brings comfort to the owners but also contributes to their physical fitness. Secondly, pet ownership often encourages individuals to take on more responsibilities. In other words, pet owners must remember to carry out various tasks for their companions regularly. These tasks include feeding and grooming, which can instill positive habits such as punctuality.\nOn the contrary, some argue that instead of investing too much money and attention in domestic animals, individuals should consider donating funds to help those who are malnourished. Firstly, it is worth noting that pets may have adverse effects on people's health. Specifically, some individuals may be susceptible to infectious diseases that domestic animals can transmit. For instance, cat scratch disease can lead to symptoms like swelling, fever, and fatigue in humans. Moreover, it can be highly risky for individuals allergic to fur or animal odors to raise a pet. Additionally, pet ownership can be financially burdensome, as owners need to take their companions to the veterinarian for regular check-ups and provide them with preventive vaccinations. Furthermore, pet toys and food items sold in supermarkets can be unreasonably expensive.\nIn conclusion, some individuals do allocate an excessive amount of attention and financial resources to their pet companions, while many others face the grim reality of malnourishment.\n"

      "paragraph": "The question of whether animals should be kept in zoos has always been a controversial debate. Animal rights activists believe that keeping them behind metal bars is an evil act, while others insist that keeping endangered species in containment is necessary to defend them from outside threats like poaching and climate change. Although keeping animals in captivity might sound unethical to some people, I strongly believe that it is a crucial act to protect these animals. I will discuss both of these opinions and express my view.\nOn the one hand, the exposure of many zoos with cruel treatment and terrible living conditions in the past left a poor impression on the industry. Additionally, most animals kept away from their natural habitat in the wild don't seem to be happy, and some become weaker and more prone to contracting illnesses than their wild counterparts. The media is another reason for the negative perception of zoos. Many animal-themed movies portray zoos as inhumane and barely caring for animals, leading audiences to believe that locking animals in zoos is unethical and barbaric.\nOn the other hand, the unpredictability of changing climate, coupled with the rapid rate of urbanization in recent decades, is gradually destroying the natural environment of rare animals. Some of these animals are almost impossible to recover, leading to an accelerated extinction rate for many rare species in the outside world. It also makes it harder for other species to find suitable habitats. Illegal hunting is a major factor contributing to the decrease in the population of various animals, including endangered ones. Despite governments around the world implementing rules to restrict hunters and poachers, the majority of these efforts prove ineffective when put into practice. Moreover, in response to the terrible conditions in some zoos, officials have tightened regulations, increasing punishments and significantly improving the living conditions of several zoos.\nIn conclusion, my opinion remains unchanged that keeping animals in zoos is necessary for their preservation. Although some animal facilities in the past treated animals in an inhumane way, the changing ecosystem and ongoing poaching continue to threaten other species. Furthermore, laws governing zoos have become more stringent, making it essential to keep endangered species in zoos.\n"

      "paragraph": "In recent times, there has been a significant increase in the production of consumer goods, which unfortunately has led to harm to our natural environment. This complex problem has several causes, and finding a solution requires cooperation from all parties involved.\nThere are various reasons behind the growth of the consumer industry and its negative impact on the environment. One of the main factors is the rapid increase in consumerism. As the demand for goods rises, the need for increased production becomes clear. As a result, industries involved in making these goods have started using more water, energy, and raw materials, depleting our valuable natural resources. This problem is worsened by insufficient environmental regulations that often fail to discourage factories from releasing harmful chemicals and toxic emissions into the environment.\nTo address these urgent environmental concerns, it is essential for individuals, businesses, and governments to work together. Firstly, governments must launch campaigns to raise public awareness about the serious environmental consequences of excessive consumerism. When people fully understand these consequences, they are more likely to adopt environmentally friendly behaviors, such as reducing excessive purchases and switching to eco-friendly alternatives. This change in consumer behavior puts pressure on companies and manufacturers to adopt more sustainable practices. At the same time, it is crucial to strengthen penalties for factories that neglect proper waste management, including longer business closures and legal consequences for those responsible for environmental violations. This two-pronged approach holds promise for significantly reducing the harmful effects of increased consumer goods production on the environment.\nIn conclusion, the uncontrolled growth of consumerism and weak environmental regulations have led to the expansion of the consumer industry, which has a significant impact on our environment. However, this challenge can be effectively addressed through coordinated efforts from governments, individuals, and corporate entities.\n"

In my opinion, several factors contribute to this issue, which could be addressed through various means by governments.\nThere are several reasons why the natural environment is adversely affected by the rise in the manufacturing of consumer items. Firstly, the construction of more factories leads to greater emissions of carbon dioxide. For example, with the considerable increase in our fashion standards today, manufacturers are compelled to establish numerous factories to meet consumer demands. Additionally, the construction of these new buildings may result in the loss of natural habitats. Specifically, as more space is used for building factories, more trees are likely to be cut down. Consequently, a vast number of species may struggle to find shelter or sources of food, potentially leading to their demise and, ultimately, extinction, as exemplified by the decline of pandas in China, which can be attributed to the loss of their habitat.\nHowever, I believe there are several solutions that governments can implement to address this issue. Firstly, authorities can encourage their citizens to embrace eco-friendly products. By doing so, businesses may need to adapt their strategies to align with consumer preferences, thereby producing environmentally friendly goods that promote a healthier environment. Furthermore, policymakers can enact more stringent regulations to prevent deforestation, thereby promoting the preservation of biodiversity. For instance, they may introduce penalties for those who violate these rules, raising awareness about the importance of environmental protection.\nIn conclusion, the significant increase in the production of consumer goods has the potential to severely harm the natural environment due to the proliferation of factories and deforestation. Nonetheless, governments can mitigate this issue by enforcing regulations against environmentally harmful activities and by promoting the use of eco-friendly products among individuals.\n"

I partly agree with this view.\nFirstly, it is true that for certain jobs, the way employees dress holds great importance. Take airline staff, for example, who interact with passengers regularly. Their attire not only reflects the airline's professionalism but also sets the tone for passengers' overall experience. This uniformity not only instills pride in representing the brand but also fosters a sense of unity among employees. This unity leads to better teamwork and a shared commitment to delivering exceptional service.\nFurthermore, having a dress code can help eliminate any bias based on clothing choices. This ensures that employees are not unfairly judged due to their fashion preferences. I remember a situation in my previous workplace where a dress code played a vital role in breaking down barriers. Colleagues from diverse backgrounds and with varying fashion tastes were no longer singled out, creating a more inclusive and harmonious work environment.\nHowever, it's crucial to consider the nature of the job when implementing a dress code. In some professions, the impact of clothing choices on work quality may be minimal, and forcing a dress code may not be necessary.\nIn conclusion, the importance of a dress code at work varies depending on the type of job.

I partially agree with this perspective because it can indeed contribute to enhancing one's attractiveness and self-assurance but also comes with a range of drawbacks. In this essay, I will elucidate the reasons behind people's choice to undergo surgery and share my opinion on this matter.\nThere are numerous benefits associated with the decision to undergo cosmetic surgery. First and foremost, it can empower individuals to radiate confidence and charm. For instance, take the case of Duc Phuc, a renowned singer in Vietnam, who fell victim to verbal abuse. However, after undergoing plastic surgery, he was able to confidently grace the stage and garnered support from the audience. In this way, he experienced the fullness of life. Second, cosmetic surgery can also open up a plethora of opportunities that can significantly impact one's career prospects. Many individuals view it as a once-in-a-lifetime chance, as it can broaden their social circle and elevate their quality of life.\nOn the flip side, there are also noteworthy drawbacks that merit our attention. Cosmetic surgery necessitates a substantial financial investment and entails long-term efforts to mitigate physical risks. Furthermore, it often results in the loss of natural beauty. A prime illustration of this can be seen in beauty pageants in Thailand, where women heavily rely on cosmetic procedures, resulting in a homogenized appearance. This phenomenon has sparked debates in the media, questioning whether artificial beauty has eclipsed natural beauty.\nIn conclusion, plastic surgery remains a contentious phenomenon in society.

In my view, while this may have some negative consequences, I believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\nOn one hand, a significant issue when using social networks to replace in-person interaction is that these platforms tend to reduce the level of interaction between individuals. This is primarily because people often express their emotions through emojis and messages rather than through verbal communication, resulting in conversations that lack authenticity and fail to establish a genuine connection. Another concern is that people are more inclined to exhibit discourteous behavior towards fellow internet users, as they may not be attuned to the feelings of others and often lack a personal connection. For example, during online gaming sessions, players frequently engage in disputes and use offensive language, which can occasionally have a detrimental impact on the emotions of others and hurt their feelings.\nDespite the aforementioned drawbacks, I believe that the benefits of communication via social media platforms hold greater significance. Firstly, one advantage of using social media is that it overcomes the barriers of geographical distance. Thanks to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and others, students and individuals living abroad can maintain regular video calls with their parents and friends, thereby nurturing strong relationships with their loved ones. Another positive aspect of this is the educational benefits it offers. Given the high demand for language learning, marketing skills, and investment knowledge in today's world, students now have more opportunities to learn from proficient instructors via the internet. They can also use social media to ask questions and practice speaking in foreign languages.\nIn conclusion, while the use of social media may decrease face-to-face interactions and sometimes lead to discourteous behavior, I maintain the belief that social networking sites play a critical role in enabling people to stay connected with friends and family.

However, I believe that a well-defined dress code not only enhances professionalism, aligning with the company's branding but also plays a pivotal role in fostering a cohesive work environment, and ultimately impacting the quality of work.\nTo commence with, there are jobs where one's attire can exert an impact. Frontline personnel, wherein one?? attire may elicit either favorable or unfavorable impressions, should be sufficiently presentable to receive customers or guests. Therefore, such personnel should have uniforms to show their professionalism. This is especially true in business models based on business-to-client modeling as having a dress code is quintessential to the organization's branding. For instance, in my previous job at a renowned hotel chain, all employees wore uniforms that featured the company logo. This uniformity not only created a sense of pride in representing the brand but also made us feel like part of a unified team, leading to improved collaboration and a shared commitment to providing exceptional service.\nAnother justification is that implementing a dress code removes any preconceived notions about clothing choices, ensuring that employees are not judged based on their fashion preferences. This promotes a greater sense of group cohesion and commonality among team members, as they can focus on their work rather than clothing-related biases. In my previous workplace, when we implemented a dress code, I noticed that colleagues stopped making judgments based on clothing choices.

However, I firmly believe that this primary responsibility should lie with parents.\nTeaching children life skills during their formative years offers several advantages. When children acquire these skills within a classroom environment, they tend to develop greater independence. This newfound self-reliance means they won't have to depend on their parents for everyday tasks like cooking, cleaning, and laundry. This shift can provide a sense of relief to both children and their parents, fostering increased self-confidence and capability in children. Moreover, classroom settings allow children to learn life skills in groups, exposing them to diverse ideas and approaches. This interaction enables them to learn from one another, enhancing their understanding of these crucial skills.\nHowever, there are also notable drawbacks to teaching life skills in a classroom. One primary concern is that this approach may not feel entirely natural. Children often hesitate to share personal information about their families and home lives with strangers, potentially causing discomfort when discussing such intimate matters in front of their peers. Additionally, not all children thrive in traditional classroom settings. Some may prefer learning through hands-on experiences and struggle to benefit from conventional teaching methods.\nIn conclusion, there are compelling arguments in favor of schools imparting some life skills to children, and I do not oppose the idea of schools offering basic training in this regard.

Advocates of this view contend that disciplines like medicine, engineering, and information technology offer more tangible benefits compared to certain art degrees. From a personal standpoint, it can be argued that these courses yield more job opportunities, facilitate career advancement, result in higher salaries, and consequently enhance students' overall quality of life. On a societal level, mandating specific university subjects allows governments to ensure that knowledge and skill gaps within the economy are addressed. Additionally, a focus on technology in higher education can potentially lead to groundbreaking innovations, economic growth, and heightened future prosperity.\nHowever, in spite of these arguments, I hold the belief that university students should have the liberty to choose their preferred fields of study. I am of the opinion that society stands to gain more when students are genuinely passionate about their learning pursuits. Furthermore, it is impossible to accurately predict which areas of knowledge will hold the most significance for society in the future. It is conceivable that employers may come to value creative thinking skills over practical or technical abilities.

      "paragraph": "As someone who relies on vehicles that travel on roads, I personally lean towards the suggestion of allocating more funds to roads rather than railways. I agree with this statement because in today's world, people predominantly use roads for transportation rather than trains. Additionally, the rising number of road accidents calls for increased government spending to address this issue.\nIt has become increasingly common for people to commute using cars, buses, motorcycles, and other road-based vehicles. Therefore, governments should prioritize the enhancement of all types of roads, including even the smallest ones. Concrete examples of this approach are evident in governments' expenditures on road cleaning and maintenance. However, improving road conditions is not the sole area where government funds should be directed. The escalating rate of car accidents is a primary reason for my support of the statement above.\nAs we are all aware, in recent years, road-based vehicles have become the primary mode of transportation. This has resulted in a higher incidence of car accidents. In Vietnam, for instance, there have been approximately 11,000 reported cases of car accidents across the entire country, resulting in the tragic loss of more than 6,000 lives. This is an urgent issue that requires the attention of every government and necessitates the allocation of financial resources to address it. Implementing prominent road signs to alert citizens about accident-prone areas is one practical solution.\nIn conclusion, governments should allocate more funding to roads. This approach will contribute to enhancing safety for citizens worldwide.\n"

      "paragraph": "Education is continually improving, and there are varying opinions regarding the courses university students should pursue. Some advocate for the freedom to choose their favorite subjects, while others argue that they should focus on practical fields like science and technology for future success. I am inclined to support the former perspective for several reasons.\nOn one hand, it's evident why science and technology majors attract attention. Our society is becoming more interconnected and progressive, making these subjects vital for future prosperity and recognition. For instance, statistics reveal that less than 10 percent of high school graduates opt for these disciplines, falling short of the current societal demand. Consequently, IT professionals and scientists often receive higher salaries compared to others. This sometimes compels parents to push their children into undesirable courses, potentially dampening their enthusiasm for learning.\nOn the other hand, permitting students to pursue their interests can lead to greater job satisfaction. While these pursuits may not always yield lucrative incomes, job satisfaction plays a pivotal role in one's overall happiness at work. Elon Musk, the renowned billionaire of the 21st century, serves as a compelling example. He chose not to attend Harvard University, despite his parents' earnest efforts to persuade him. Instead, he delved into coding operating systems and established his own company at a young age. Musk's story underscores the idea that individuals who are passionate about their chosen path will persevere despite challenges.\nIn conclusion, science and technology fields offer promising career opportunities for those inclined towards logical thinking. However, not everyone possesses the aptitude for these demanding professions. Therefore, it is crucial for students to identify their true interests early on or take a gap year to explore their passions and chart a path towards success.\n"

      "paragraph": "\"Rules and laws are the cornerstone of our modern society. Many believe that a society where individuals have unrestricted freedom would struggle to function effectively. In my view, I wholeheartedly agree with this perspective.\nFirst and foremost, the legal system plays a vital role in ensuring the well-being of citizens and the stability of a nation. Sacrificing a degree of personal freedom is a reasonable trade-off for the protection provided by the government. Specifically, rules and regulations are advantageous for law-abiding citizens as they shield them from fraud and criminal activities, fostering a sense of security within the country. Additionally, at a societal level, the enactment of regulations allows policymakers to effectively manage and control various aspects of society. For instance, when Vietnamese citizens adhered to social distancing rules during the Covid-19 pandemic, the country gained international recognition for effectively curbing the spread of this deadly virus.\nFurthermore, I contend that a society would descend into chaos if individuals were not guided by rules and laws. In other words, without regulations that promote fairness, justice, and safety within a nation, individuals might engage in thoughtless activities that have adverse effects on the well-being and social progress of others. For example, if there were no laws against theft and violence, people could commit crimes without fearing the consequences, resulting in a breakdown of social order.\nIn conclusion, rules and legislations provide a framework that shapes human behavior and establishes boundaries for acceptable conduct. Therefore, it is imperative for the government to employ this effective tool to create a peaceful nation where individuals can feel confident in their safety and that of their families.\"\n"

      "paragraph": "In recent times, both men and women tend to invest a significant amount of their finances in enhancing their physical appearance. This essay aims to explore the underlying causes and potential consequences of this behavior.\nTo commence, the inclination of many individuals to allocate financial resources towards enhancing their appearance can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, there is a growing demand for professions that place a high emphasis on attractiveness. Consequently, many employers now consider a pleasing appearance to be a prerequisite. For example, when introducing new products to the public, an attractive appearance can captivate the attention of the target audience. Secondly, an appealing appearance can facilitate the expansion of one's social circle. This is because an attractive appearance can draw the interest of a diverse range of people, thereby facilitating the formation of new friendships.\nThe trend of investing money in improving one's appearance can yield both positive and negative consequences for society. On the positive side, this inclination can provide beauty-related businesses and companies with ample opportunities to generate substantial profits. This, in turn, can lead to advancements in the field of cosmetics and beauty-related services. However, excessive expenditure on beauty care may lead to an overemphasis on physical appearance in society. Consequently, individuals with remarkable talents but less appealing looks may find themselves undervalued, thus limiting their chances to contribute their skills and abilities to the community. This could potentially result in the underutilization of valuable talents, which is detrimental to the progress of society.\nIn conclusion, the growing propensity to spend excessive amounts of money on enhancing one's beauty can be attributed to the increasing demand for attractive appearances in certain professions and the significance of physical appeal in expanding one's social network. While this trend can contribute significantly to the profitability of beauty-related enterprises, it may also marginalize talented individuals, hindering their potential contributions to societal development.\n"

      "paragraph": "Traditional food is presently undergoing substantial changes, gradually giving way to new dietary trends. The primary factor driving this shift is the changing preferences of individuals. In my personal view, this is the primary reason, though there are additional contributing factors to consider. In the following essay, I will elucidate all the causes behind this transformation. In my opinion, I firmly believe that this phenomenon carries more drawbacks than advantages.\nFirst and foremost, the transformation in traditional cuisine is closely tied to the diverse preferences of people. Over time, individuals have developed a desire for culinary innovation. The discovery of new spices and herbs has piqued their curiosity, leading them to experiment with different ingredients and concoct novel dishes. Consequently, dishes such as burgers, pizzas, and others have emerged, gradually supplanting their time-honored counterparts. Rather than adhering to conventional culinary practices, people now prepare meals according to their personal tastes. For example, some prefer their food spicier, while others favor savory or sweet flavors. This variation in preferences has been a driving force behind people's willingness to embrace new diets, ultimately displacing traditional ones.\nConversely, this divergence in culinary preferences has led to the decline of traditional cuisine. The younger generation, largely unfamiliar with their heritage's culinary traditions, is increasingly disconnected from their cultural roots. It is often said that \"food connects us to our heritage,\" but with these culinary alterations, that connection is eroding. This shift has also contributed to younger individuals developing a strong inclination toward fast food and unhealthy dietary choices, which they have grown up with. According to numerous reports and news sources, this phenomenon is causing a significant loss of our cultural heritage while simultaneously promoting unhealthy eating habits.\nIn conclusion, the phenomenon of traditional meals being supplanted by a new diet is concerning.

      "paragraph": "The majority of the general public contends that implementing a dress code in the workplace is of relatively minor importance since it does not directly influence work productivity. However, I believe that a well-defined dress code not only enhances professionalism, aligning with the company's branding but also plays a crucial role in fostering a cohesive work environment and ultimately impacting the quality of work.\nTo begin with, there are jobs where one's attire can exert an impact. Frontline personnel, wherein one's attire may elicit either favorable or unfavorable impressions, should be sufficiently presentable to receive customers or guests. Therefore, such personnel should have uniforms to show their professionalism. This is especially true in business models based on business-to-client interactions; formal wear and having a dress code are quintessential to the organization's branding. For instance, in my previous job at a renowned hotel chain, all employees, from the front desk staff to housekeepers, wore uniforms that featured the company logo. This uniformity not only created a sense of pride in representing the brand but also made us feel like part of a unified team, leading to improved collaboration and a shared commitment to providing exceptional service.\nAnother justification is that implementing a dress code removes any preconceived notions about clothing choices, ensuring that employees are not judged based on their fashion preferences. This promotes a greater sense of group cohesion and commonality among team members, as they can focus on their work rather than clothing-related biases. In addition, having the same attire can eliminate social inequality between the affluent and the less privileged, enhancing the connection among employees regardless of the wealth gap.\nIn conclusion, while one's choice of attire or dress code at work does not directly influence productivity, its significance is worth contemplating depending on the nature of one's occupation. Moreover, wearing the same set of clothes conveys a distinct message of egalitarianism to the employees.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's world, the significant increase in the manufacturing of consumer goods has had a detrimental impact on our environment. In my view, there are various reasons contributing to this problem, and governments can take specific steps to address it.\nThere are several factors responsible for the worsening condition of the natural environment due to the increased production of consumer items. Firstly, the establishment of more factories leads to higher emissions of carbon dioxide. For example, as our demand for fashion has risen significantly, manufacturers have had to construct numerous factories to meet consumer needs. Additionally, the construction of these new factories often encroaches on natural habitats. When more land is used for building factories, it results in the clearing of forests and the destruction of trees. Consequently, many species lose their shelter and sources of sustenance, increasing the risk of their extinction. For instance, the decline in panda populations can be attributed to the loss of their habitats.\nHowever, I believe that there are a few solutions that governments can adopt to mitigate this phenomenon. First and foremost, authorities can encourage citizens to adopt eco-friendly products. By doing so, businesses may need to revise their strategies and produce environmentally friendly goods to meet consumer demands, thus contributing to a healthier environment. Furthermore, policymakers can enforce regulations to protect forests from destruction, providing all animal species with a chance to live in peace and maintain the diversity of natural species.\nIn conclusion, the substantial increase in the production of consumer goods poses a significant threat to the natural environment due to the proliferation of factories and deforestation.

In this essay, I will discuss both views and share my perspective.\nOn one hand, some people think that allocating funds for family celebrations is simply a way to squander money. One of the primary concerns is the financial burden that extravagant celebrations can place on families. Going beyond one's means can lead to debt and financial stress, which may result in long-term negative consequences such as conflicts among family members. Secondly, these celebrations occur only a few times, often leading to the wastage of food and other resources, without much appreciation from the guests. Therefore, the money spent on them could be put to more practical uses, such as paying for utilities, food supplies, healthcare, and their children's education.\nOn the other hand, spending on household activities and celebrations can be considered reasonable due to several benefits. Firstly, family celebrations mark important milestones and life events like weddings, birthdays, and anniversaries. The expenditure on these occasions can strengthen the bonds between family members. For instance, a wedding serves as a special occasion for people to gather and catch up with their relatives regarding their current situations, such as jobs, marital status, and life events, which can help foster their relationships. Celebrations often involve special activities, decorations, and gatherings that create lasting memories for both the individuals celebrating and their loved ones. These memories can be cherished for a lifetime.\nIn conclusion, the decision to spend money on family celebrations should be made with careful consideration of one's financial situation, values, and priorities.

      "paragraph": "The prevalence of social media has gradually replaced face-to-face meetings for many individuals in society. In my view, although this trend may have some positive aspects, I believe that its negative consequences outweigh the advantages.\nOn one hand, one of the primary benefits of online communication is the ability to connect with a wide range of relationships, even when we are pressed for time to meet in person. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of the population had to remain at home and maintain contact with their families, friends, and colleagues solely through social media platforms. Additionally, online interaction can help people save both time and money. Specifically, with just a social media application like VideoCall, you can easily reach out to someone who may be halfway across the world, overcoming geographical constraints. This process only takes a few minutes, and importantly, this application offers free calls for the first 20 minutes, resulting in cost savings. Thus, thanks to the widespread adoption of social networks, the lives of the general population have become more convenient.\nHowever, despite these mentioned benefits, I believe that the disadvantages of social networking sites need to be given more careful consideration. Firstly, ensuring quality in online interactions is more challenging than in face-to-face conversations. Numerous surveys have indicated that individuals often use more informal language online and may sometimes disregard ethical standards in their communication. Consequently, this can lead to ineffective communication. Secondly, the tendency for users to primarily communicate through social networks can create obstacles when they need to interact outside of these platforms. For example, many people have a habit of expressing their emotions through status updates on their personal profiles rather than communicating directly in their daily lives. As a result, it becomes difficult for them to express their true feelings, and face-to-face interactions can also become a challenge.\nIn conclusion, while online interaction offers communication benefits, I maintain my belief that direct, in-person interaction still remains the most efficient means of communication.\n"

In others, children focus on a narrow range of subjects related to a particular career. Which of these two systems is more appropriate in today?? world?\nSecondary schools in certain countries integrate a diverse array of subjects to offer a comprehensive education, whereas, in other countries, students primarily concentrate on some career-oriented disciplines. While I acknowledge that general education has many merits, the latter cannot be overlooked.\nIt is prudent to recognize that studying a diverse range of subjects such as mathematics, literature, and social sciences offers students a broad skill set and helps them explore various aspects of life. Moreover, with knowledge from the breadth of subjects, students could gain a comprehensive overview of many fields in life, helping them enhance their essential personal skills and empowering learners to address various challenges in their professions. To illustrate, without a profound knowledge of math or finance, housewives would have formidable challenges managing their family budget and expenditures. Conversely, individuals proficient in mathematics might fail to appreciate socio-economic matters if they don't have a background in some social subjects. In addition, an education system with a variety of subjects could endow students with crucial orientation to determine their career passion, which hardly comes into shape during their teenage years. It is a wide-ranging curriculum that offers secondary school learners opportunities to get engaged in a variety of subjects and fields in life to identify their career interests.\nHowever, it is also my belief that specialized training is a superior option as it facilitates the career preparation of secondary students. The main reason is that vocational education allows students to cultivate in-depth knowledge and skills in an occupation that they appeal to, thus paving the way for major professional development. In the current overwhelmingly competitive labor market, having a profound insight into a particular career would endow a young student with a competitive edge over other candidates. To illustrate this point with a baseball coach as an example, employers tend to give priority to candidates who graduated from a sports-gifted school from secondary school to high school. Furthermore, if children focus on a narrow range of subjects related to their particular careers, they would have spare time to engage in extracurricular activities, offering opportunities for enhancing soft skills like teamwork, leadership, communication, and problem-solving, among others. This combination of specialized knowledge and strong soft skills positions them better for success in their chosen professions, making career-oriented education a more fitting choice for our modern world.\nIn conclusion, while I agree that teaching a diverse subject has many merits, I argue that a specialized training system, offering students optimal professional preparation for achieving success, is better suited to the contemporary world.\n"

      "question": "Discuss the arguments for and against banning cell phones in some public places, and state your opinion on whether this should be done.",
      "paragraph": "It is widely believed that cell phones should be prohibited in some public sites because they are harmful and disruptive. While this thinking is valid to a certain extent, I believe that smartphones should not be banned in some public sites.\nOn the one hand, there are numerous reasons why proponents argue for the prohibition on using cell phones in certain places. Firstly, as the inherent nature of mobile phones is disruptive, they can prevent people from completing their tasks. To be more specific, in offices, employees are advised to turn their mobile phones off to focus on their work, which can enhance their work productivity. Secondly, mobile phones can be intrusive in public areas. For example, in places like libraries, where people are supposed to maintain silence and concentrate on their books or reading materials, a mobile phone's ringtone or phone conversation can entirely divert their attention, thereby disrupting the ideal work environment.\nOn the other hand, despite the aforementioned disadvantages, cell phones are useful in a number of ways. First and foremost, restricting the usage of cell phones in public places can keep people from staying in touch with their loved ones in case of an emergency and so on. Mobile phones nowadays come equipped with cameras and other services like Facebook, messaging, and entertainment. This allows them to capture pictures of events, take selfies anywhere, and share them with their friends on the go. Additionally, due to the rapid development of technology, the method of paying bills when making purchases now relies on apps on smartphones, making everything quick and convenient. For example, in China, people rarely use cash and prefer direct payment services through apps like WeChat on their phones. Therefore, not using the phone can become inconvenient when going out socializing.\nIn conclusion, laws like these may seem harsh due to the necessity of cellular devices. Nevertheless, the overuse of smartphones is increasing these days, and thus people should endeavor to curb this trend by educating and motivating others to limit the use of mobile devices and engage in physical interaction more frequently.\n"

      "question": "Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of increasing fuel prices to combat air pollution, and state your opinion on whether this is an effective solution.",
      "paragraph": "Some individuals believe that raising the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles is an effective means to combat air pollution, while others contend that there are more effective approaches to tackle this prevailing environmental issue. In my perspective, I lean towards the latter viewpoint, and in this essay, I will elucidate my stance with the following rationale.\nOn one hand, augmenting the price of fuel could yield certain advantages in mitigating ongoing environmental concerns. Firstly, such a measure may incentivize people to explore alternative sustainable modes of transportation, such as public transit, carpooling, and electric vehicles. This inclination arises from the fact that individuals are generally averse to substantial transportation expenditures. Consequently, this shift could substantially curtail the emission of carbon dioxide, a noxious byproduct of most personal modes of transportation, thereby potentially leading to an amelioration in air quality. Secondly, the heightened fuel costs could generate additional revenue streams that can be directed towards eco-friendly infrastructure development. Indeed, the funds from increased fuel expenses could be earmarked for the construction of green infrastructure projects designed to combat air pollution. These projects might encompass the installation of advanced air filtration systems or the deployment of state-of-the-art monitoring facilities for assessing air quality. Such initiatives could set in motion a chain of positive effects, not only in addressing air pollution but also in stimulating economic growth through investments in environmentally friendly infrastructure.\nOn the other hand, the steep rise in fuel prices has its drawbacks, making alternative solutions more appealing. It is undeniable that exorbitantly priced gasoline can disproportionately burden individuals with limited financial means. This demographic heavily relies on personal transportation for essential daily activities, such as commuting to work and transporting their children to school. As a result, their ability to maintain their livelihoods may be compromised due to the inability to afford the rising fuel expenses. Consequently, socioeconomic disparities may be exacerbated, exacerbating income inequality. Moreover, increasing public awareness is pivotal in addressing the prevailing air quality issues. Environmental problems, largely stemming from a lack of awareness and knowledge among the populace, are frequently triggered by individuals' actions grounded in ignorance. These actions often contribute to environmental degradation. People attempt to tackle environmental issues based on empirical experiences that may not be environmentally sustainable due to their limited understanding. Thus, educating the public about environmental problems is paramount in reducing the long-term consequences of societal ignorance regarding the state of the natural world.\nIn conclusion, while there are merits to the idea of increasing fuel expenses, such as promoting greener infrastructure and encouraging the use of sustainable transportation options, I am more inclined towards the alternative perspective. The disadvantages of excessively high gasoline prices and the importance of raising public awareness in addressing air pollution weigh heavily in favor of pursuing other avenues for improvement.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's world, there is an ongoing debate about the primary reasons for acquiring proficiency in foreign languages. Some argue that the sole purpose of learning a new language is to facilitate travel and employment opportunities in foreign lands. Conversely, others contend that there exist more compelling motives for individuals to embark on the journey of language acquisition. I wholeheartedly concur with the notion that learning foreign languages serves purposes beyond just traveling or working abroad.\nUndoubtedly, mastering a foreign language can unlock numerous prospects for individuals seeking to venture overseas for work or leisure. Firstly, language proficiency can grant individuals extended work permits, as being able to comprehend what foreign leaders and colleagues are saying enables more effective collaboration. Additionally, those who are well-versed in the language of the country they plan to visit can gain deeper insights into its cultures and traditions. This, in turn, enhances their overall experience, making them feel more at home while exploring renowned destinations or savoring local cuisine.\nNevertheless, I firmly believe that the advantages of learning new languages extend far beyond the realms of travel and work opportunities. One of the paramount benefits is the broadening of one's intellectual horizons, as different languages offer access to an array of captivating books and diverse sources of information. Mastery of various languages equips individuals with the invaluable ability to tap into a wealth of knowledge from around the world. Moreover, language proficiency fosters meaningful social connections, which are pivotal for a fulfilling life. In addition to cultivating good habits, effective communication with people from different countries is a key factor in achieving a healthy and fulfilling life. Learning a new language facilitates interactions with individuals from diverse backgrounds, reducing the risk of feeling isolated or experiencing depression. Building friendships with both local and international acquaintances enriches one's social life, contributing to overall well-being.\nIn conclusion, the acquisition of foreign languages serves purposes that extend beyond the scope of travel and employment abroad. It encompasses the enrichment of knowledge through exposure to different linguistic realms and plays a vital role in nurturing a healthy and connected life. Therefore, I firmly assert that the value of learning distinct languages transcends the mere pursuit of travel and career opportunities in foreign lands.\n"

      "paragraph": "Thanks to technological advancements, driverless vehicles are rapidly becoming a reality. It is expected that within a few decades, all cars, buses, and trucks will operate without the need for human drivers. In my view, the advantages of driverless transportation outweigh the disadvantages.\nOn one hand, it is true that driverless cars can present certain challenges, including accidents, casualties, and job displacement. Since these vehicles rely on software and computers for operation, there is a risk of accidents caused by software glitches, viruses, or hacking. Hackers could potentially compromise the vehicle's control system, leading to unpredictable harm to people and property. Moreover, some roads, particularly in less developed countries with potholes and inadequate road signage, may not be suitable for driverless vehicles. Additionally, as the number of driverless vehicles increases, many individuals currently employed as taxi and truck drivers could lose their jobs. These job losses could result in societal issues such as increased crime rates.\nOn the other hand, technology-related errors are less common than human errors when it comes to road safety. Human error is responsible for approximately 95 percent of all accidents worldwide. With the introduction of driverless vehicles, this human error factor can be eliminated, making road travel safer for everyone. People with limited driving abilities or those facing challenges while driving can still commute safely in driverless cars. Furthermore, driverless vehicles offer the advantage of reducing the time individuals spend behind the wheel. Additionally, the adoption of automated vehicles on the roads can lead to reduced energy consumption and decreased pollution, making it a more environmentally-friendly mode of transportation.\nIn conclusion, while driverless transportation may present certain challenges, its positive aspects outweigh the negatives. It stands as a promising technological innovation for the future, offering improved safety, convenience, and environmental benefits.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's world, it is crucial for us to recognize our role in shaping modern society and contributing positively to our communities. While some individuals argue that the responsibility of guiding children to become valuable members of society falls on parents, others contend that schools should play a significant role in this process. This essay will explore both perspectives.\nParents play an indispensable role in shaping a child's character and values. During their formative years, children spend the majority of their time with their parents, making them highly susceptible to parental influence. Consequently, children often emulate their parents' behavior and traits. Therefore, it is reasonable to assert that parents bear a primary responsibility for instilling in their children the values and behaviors necessary to become productive members of society. For instance, if a child frequently witnesses their parents littering on the streets, they may imitate this behavior and fail to recognize the importance of environmental protection. Hence, it is evident that parents should be actively involved in teaching their children how to make a positive contribution to society.\nOn the other hand, proponents of the view that schools should shoulder this responsibility argue that teachers, who are also parents themselves, can impart essential qualities of good citizenship to children. These qualities may include a strong work ethic and integrity. Additionally, parents with demanding schedules may struggle to find the time and energy required to teach these fundamental values to their children without the support of schools and teachers.\nIn conclusion, the question of who is primarily responsible for nurturing well-behaved future citizens remains a topic of debate. In my opinion, both parents and teachers are equally essential in this regard. Parents have a unique role in influencing their children during their formative years, while teachers at school can reinforce these lessons and provide additional guidance. Ultimately, it is a collective effort between parents and educators to ensure that our children grow up to be responsible and valuable members of society.\n"

      "paragraph": "Accommodation has always been a fundamental necessity in everyone's life; however, there are still those who cannot afford it. Therefore, it is believed by some that the government should take on the responsibility of providing homes to these individuals. Nevertheless, this idea should not be put into practice due to its unfairness and impracticality.\nThe notion of providing houses to the underprivileged is undeniably unfair. This is because many individuals diligently save money throughout their lives to secure their own homes. It would be unacceptable for them to discover that others are being freely granted houses, potentially leading to social unrest. Furthermore, such a flawed policy could hinder the country's economic development, as an increasing number of residents might simply wait for free accommodation without making any contributions to society.\nAnother reason why this perspective is not supported is because it is an almost impossible mission. Offering free houses to the poor would require a massive budget on the part of the government, as there are thousands of citizens who cannot afford to purchase a house. With a limited budget, it becomes unfeasible to implement such a scheme, not to mention the other essential areas that require financial assistance, such as education, healthcare, and transportation. Moreover, it is nearly impossible to accurately determine the number of people who cannot afford a house in vast countries like China and India. It's also crucial to acknowledge that some people may assume false identities to take advantage of the scheme, rendering it impractical.\nIn conclusion, while housing is indeed a pressing issue, and many residents struggle to secure a home for themselves, the idea of providing free accommodation to these individuals is unrealistic due to the aforementioned reasons.

When it comes to academic ability, I firmly believe that all applicants should be granted admission to educational programs. I will elaborate on my perspective in this essay.\nOn one hand, it is crucial for everyone to prioritize their mental and physical well-being. Allowing students to enter university without requiring entrance exams provides an opportunity for those who may not excel academically but are still eager to learn and grow. Consequently, admitting students based solely on excellent marks may not be necessary.\nFurthermore, the competition for university admission is fierce. Many individuals aspire to graduate from prestigious universities worldwide. As academic pressures mount, some institutions have started to admit only exceptionally capable students. However, for the overall development of students, it is essential not to exclude those who may lack certain academic skills.\nOn the other hand, it is worth considering that denying admission to students based on their recent academic performance could be unjust. Personal circumstances often play a significant role in one's academic achievements. For instance, when a group of students collaborates on a project, having varying levels of academic skills can lead to innovative ideas and a more robust learning experience.\nIn conclusion, I believe that admitting students to colleges and universities, regardless of their academic abilities, can have a positive impact. The support of peers and the desire to achieve can significantly influence a person's potential and lead to remarkable growth.

      "paragraph": "In some countries, there is a growing trend where more and more individuals choose to delay becoming parents in order to focus on their careers. This has led to an increase in the age gap between children and their parents compared to earlier generations. From my perspective, the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages.\nOn one hand, postponing parenthood can have some noticeable drawbacks for both parents and their children. Firstly, pregnancy at an older age tends to have a negative impact on both the physical and mental health of the mother. For instance, numerous studies have shown that women who give birth at an older age are more likely to experience depression or have a higher risk of miscarriage compared to younger mothers. Additionally, a wider generation gap can result in various conflicts and misunderstandings between parents and their offspring. Consequently, strained family relationships can increase the incidence of domestic violence, which can have detrimental effects on children's behavior and outlook.\nOn the other hand, I believe that the benefits of a larger age gap between parents and their children outweigh the disadvantages. Most young parents may lack the life experiences necessary to pass down valuable wisdom and guide their children, whereas older parents have a wealth of knowledge accumulated through years of life experiences. Moreover, individuals who become parents at an early age may face financial constraints, which can lead to economic burdens for some families. This financial strain not only affects the family's budget but also places additional pressure on social welfare systems.\nIn conclusion, while the current trend of greater age disparities between parents and children may have some disadvantages, I firmly believe that the advantages are more significant. Older parents can offer a wealth of valuable experiences and knowledge to their children, ultimately benefiting both individuals and society as a whole.\n"

Some argue that global sporting events have the potential to bridge the gap between people of varying age groups and nationalities, while others contend that these events can escalate into full-blown clashes. In this response, we will endeavor to examine this contentious issue from both perspectives before presenting my own viewpoint.\nOn one hand, many people assert that international sports competitions can exacerbate differences between people and nations due to conflicts and confrontations. It is undeniable that there are often instances where there are aggressive or confrontational individuals among the spectators at every match, who may be prone to engaging in physical altercations or verbal disputes. For instance, consider the intense rivalry between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Philadelphia Flyers in hockey, widely recognized as the \"Battle of Pennsylvania,\" which can lead to clashes between supporters of these two teams. Consequently, it is evident that sporting events sometimes face criticism in this regard.\nOn the other hand, opponents argue that international competitive sports play a crucial role in fostering understanding among individuals and nations. This is because sports promote values such as teamwork, fair play, and respect, which are universal and can help bridge cultural gaps. Take, for instance, the FIFA World Cup, which draws a crowd of over 3 million individuals who gather to support their respective teams on a quadrennial basis. As a result, this assembly of diverse fans positively contributes to building relationships among people from various backgrounds and facilitates cultural exchange.\nIn conclusion, while many people assert that global sporting events can lead to conflicts among people and nations, I firmly believe that these events have the potential to bridge these gaps.

One such reason is that they do not need to adapt to new facilities elsewhere. In essence, tools and resources vary between different countries, and adapting to these disparities can be challenging. For instance, in China, citizens are required to use Baidu instead of the widely used Google as their search engine. Additionally, a point worth considering is the sense of gratitude towards the country that provided their education. Although this may seem unconventional, it is an important factor to ponder. The country that trained them may have a genuine need for their services in return.\nOn the other hand, I align with those who believe that experts should have the freedom to work anywhere they desire, and there are several compelling reasons for this stance. Firstly, relocating to another country for work can offer them a more conducive working environment, enabling them to perform at their best.

It is evident that an extended period behind bars can deter repeat offenders from committing further crimes, thereby reducing the risk of residents falling victim to violent acts. For instance, notorious murderers and swindlers, who have inflicted significant harm on individuals' lives, especially their victims, should remain out of public view.

Consequently, making trade decisions would become more straightforward. Another positive aspect is the potential improvement in the living standards of citizens. By adhering to the same regulations and decisions, sharing the same benefits, and pursuing common developmental goals, conflicts and wars between ethnic groups could be mitigated.\nHowever, a globally unified government could also introduce a host of significant disadvantages. One of the most severe drawbacks of a unipolar world order is the erosion of cultural diversity. A centralized authority would likely prioritize and promote the culture of more developed regions, potentially at the expense of emerging ones.

In support of the proposition, this essay will provide a comprehensive explanation of why international cooperation plays a pivotal role in addressing global dilemmas, such as economic crises and environmental issues.\nOne of the primary reasons to emphasize the importance of multilateral cooperation is the urgent need to combat environmental challenges. It is widely acknowledged that issues like climate change and global warming transcend national boundaries and cannot be effectively addressed on a regional scale. Therefore, when multiple countries collaborate by sharing expertise, technology, and resources, they can collectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the devastating effects of rising temperatures.\nClose-knit relationships between countries can also accelerate economic growth among different nations. Every country experiences periods of economic prosperity and downturns. It is evident that many developing countries struggle to cope with prolonged economic recessions. Therefore, it becomes imperative for these nations to seek financial assistance from other countries to maintain their living standards. A prime example illustrating this argument is Greece, a country that experienced a severe economic crisis but was able to revive its economy by receiving substantial financial support from other European Union countries. This highlights the tangible benefits of global unity in addressing economic challenges.\nIn conclusion, global cooperation is a viable approach to addressing a range of critical concerns related to economic stability and environmental sustainability. It is imperative for every country to enhance collaboration and strengthen global ties to pave the way for a promising future for civilization.\"\n"

      "question": "Should governments provide free university education to all students?",
      "paragraph": "It is widely believed that providing free university education to all students, regardless of their financial situation, is an essential right for every student. However, I respectfully disagree with this perspective. In the following paragraphs, I will explain why I believe that offering free university education can have adverse effects on both governments and students.\nI firmly believe that every student should have the opportunity to attend college and pursue tertiary degrees. This is because, in my opinion, the knowledge acquired at the university level should be accessible to all. Furthermore, all students, regardless of their financial backgrounds, possess equal intelligence and academic potential, and thus, they should have equal opportunities to gain admission to universities.\nHowever, it is my contention that governments are not obligated to fully cover the educational expenses of university attendees. Additionally, the quality of education may suffer due to the increased number of students in a single class, which can hinder teachers from providing comprehensive attention to each student. Indeed, class size significantly influences how students interact with their instructors and peers. If classes become too crowded, students may be reluctant to ask questions, which can ultimately result in poorer performance at the university level.\nIn conclusion, while I agree that pursuing tertiary education is a fundamental right for everyone, it is my belief that governments should not bear the full burden of study costs. Thus far, there have been numerous opportunities for scholarships or exemptions, and I believe that these are the most effective methods of supporting students.\n"

      "paragraph": "I strongly believe that every individual should have the opportunity to access higher education because it is a fundamental human right. Moreover, obtaining a university degree serves as tangible proof that students can seek well-paying employment. When educational opportunities are extended to all, it fosters social mobility and contributes to a nation's development.\nHowever, the government should not be solely responsible for bearing the entire cost of free university education. Firstly, educational institutions require substantial funds annually to maintain state-of-the-art equipment essential for effective teaching. Secondly, in the case of developing nations, offering free university education may necessitate borrowing significant sums from developed countries. Lastly, the most concerning consequence would be the increase in international debt.\nIn conclusion, while I firmly support the notion that everyone should have the right to pursue higher education, I believe that the financial burden of providing free university education should be shared among various stakeholders, taking into account the complexities and economic realities involved. This balanced approach can ensure both accessibility to education and financial sustainability.\n"

      "paragraph": "It is argued that reading for pleasure can enhance imagination and language skills more effectively than watching TV. From my perspective, I partially agree with this view for several reasons.\nOn the one hand, it is clear why reading is considered a good way to stimulate imagination and improve language abilities. When people read books, especially those without images, such as novels, they must envision the places, characters, and scenes described in the story. Furthermore, language skills can be enhanced through reading in a practical manner. In fact, various educational and reference materials can provide knowledge about words, their meanings, and how to use them. For instance, an Oxford dictionary provides detailed information on English grammar structures, vocabularies, and pronunciation. Consequently, books can assist individuals not only in visualization but also in enhancing their language abilities in various ways.\nOn the other hand, TV can also offer benefits for individuals looking to improve their language skills in certain situations, and we should not underestimate them. It is undeniable that when watching films on TV, viewers encounter a significant number of words displayed through subtitles, enabling them to understand how these words are used in appropriate contexts. This can also help people improve their pronunciation as they listen to native actors and actresses conversing. However, in my opinion, TV may not significantly boost everyone's imagination. Since TV presents content and characters directly through films and programs, the audience is not required to engage in much imaginative thinking. In this regard, books appear to be more effective.\nIn conclusion, while books are beneficial for visualization and language skills, television still plays a vital role in developing these skills. I argue that both forms of education are crucial; therefore, I cannot wholeheartedly agree with the view that reading for pleasure is superior to watching TV in this regard.\n"

      "paragraph": "In recent years, there has been significant interest in the idea of relocating industries and businesses from major cities to rural areas. While this plan offers clear benefits, such as supporting rural growth and alleviating urban traffic congestion, it is crucial to consider the potential drawbacks. Personally, I believe that if this relocation is executed with meticulous planning and consideration, the advantages can indeed outweigh any disadvantages.\nThere are advantages to encouraging businesses and industries to make the move to rural areas. It can contribute to rural development and address the issue of overcrowding in urban areas. Cities often grapple with heavy traffic, pollution, and high living costs. Shifting industries to rural areas can distribute economic opportunities more evenly and alleviate the strain on urban resources. Consequently, this can lead to improved living conditions for city residents and a fairer distribution of wealth and resources across the nation.\nFurthermore, relocating industries to rural areas can provide a significant economic boost to these communities. It can generate more job opportunities and deter people from migrating from rural to urban regions, thereby helping mitigate overpopulation in major cities. This can also revitalize the rural economy and promote sustainable development in areas that are often overshadowed by cities.\nHowever, it is vital to acknowledge the potential downsides of this strategy. One issue to consider is its impact on the environment. Rural industries must adhere to stringent environmental regulations to prevent pollution and safeguard the natural surroundings. The construction of infrastructure to support these businesses may also have environmental consequences, such as habitat destruction or increased carbon emissions from transportation.\nIn conclusion, relocating industries and businesses from major cities to rural areas can alleviate congestion and stimulate rural economies. To ensure success, careful planning, investment in rural infrastructure, support for businesses and workers, and adherence to environmental regulations are all necessary.\n"

      "paragraph": "In recent decades, there has been a noticeable decline in the recycling of household waste. Some argue that the only way to address this issue is by making recycling a legal requirement. However, I believe that while implementing recycling laws in communities is a promising step, it is not the only solution due to certain flaws in its enactment.\nCertainly, enacting recycling laws within communities holds promise for increasing the proportion of recycled household waste. It is undeniable that many people thoughtlessly dispose of items such as plastic bags and bottles, which can have a detrimental impact on the environment and people's well-being. Therefore, when new legislation is adopted and becomes law, a greater number of people may feel compelled to engage in recycling practices to avoid severe penalties, such as hefty fines. This, in turn, is likely to result in an increase in the amount of recycled waste from households.\nHowever, it is essential to recognize that legislation alone is not sufficient. Education plays an equally fundamental and transformative role. Undoubtedly, if government-funded educational programs provide young students with a proper understanding of the importance of recycling household waste for their well-being, these individuals are likely to shift away from the habit of irresponsible waste disposal towards consistent recycling behaviors. This could significantly boost the proportion of recycled waste.\nAdditionally, it is important to consider that solely imposing new laws within communities can have adverse effects. Many economically disadvantaged individuals are often burdened with demanding workloads, which can leave them mentally and physically exhausted. Therefore, introducing new legislation in such circumstances may further strain these individuals and worsen their overall living conditions.\nIn conclusion, while enacting recycling laws can be a viable approach, I am of the opinion that it should not be the sole method. Education also plays a crucial role in increasing the proportion of recycled waste. A comprehensive solution that combines legislation and education is more likely to achieve the desired outcome of reducing household waste and promoting responsible recycling practices.\n"

      "paragraph": "\"In the realm of cultural exchange, individuals often seek to explore, experience, and embrace diverse cultures. There is an argument suggesting that one can acquire profound insights into culture through sources like books, documents, films, and the Internet, eliminating the need for travel. I strongly disagree with this perspective, and in this essay, I will articulate my viewpoints on the matter.\nFirst and foremost, travel offers numerous unique advantages that cannot be fully grasped through passive means such as reading, watching, or browsing. Through travel, people have the opportunity to immerse themselves in culture in a way that is tangible, intuitive, and dynamic. There are countless aspects of culture that can only be truly appreciated through personal experience, as it is highly dependent on individual perspectives, lifestyles, and tastes. For instance, Chinese cuisine may not align with American palates, but it may resonate perfectly with Vietnamese tastes. Furthermore, the thriving tourism industry serves as a testament to the allure of travel, attracting people from around the world.\nAnother critical aspect to consider is the objectivity of information found in books, films, and online sources. Every written work carries the perspective and bias of its author, often with a particular agenda. Some travel literature and news articles may be crafted to promote tourism in certain destinations, even if the actual conditions on the ground do not match the descriptions provided. Similarly, travel shows often present a carefully curated and overly positive portrayal of places while downplaying their shortcomings.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe in the value of firsthand cultural experiences through travel.

      "paragraph": "Obesity is a growing public health concern in various parts of the world. In this essay, I will explore the possible causes of this problem and propose some solutions.\nFirstly, there are several reasons contributing to the increasing rates of obesity. One prominent factor is the rising prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle. Compared to the past, people now experience higher levels of stress due to their hectic lives. This has led to a shift from consuming nutritious foods to opting for fast food and processed snacks. For instance, busy professionals often choose to dine at fast-food chains like McDonald's or KFC to save time, even though these options are not conducive to good health. Additionally, a lack of physical activity leads to a reduced ability to convert consumed calories into energy, resulting in the accumulation of fat.\nFurthermore, adopting and maintaining healthy eating habits, stress-reduction techniques, and a positive approach to regular exercise can significantly reduce the risk of obesity. For example, individuals who engage in any form of physical activity, such as regular walking, tend to have lower body fat percentages. Promoting the importance of a nutritious diet can also deter people from consuming unhealthy foods. Swapping out pizzas and burgers for milder options like fresh juices and salads during lunch is a simple yet effective change. In some instances, medical professionals can play a crucial role by educating the public about the detrimental effects of obesity.\nIn conclusion, obesity is undoubtedly a significant issue, largely stemming from an unhealthy diet and a lack of physical activity. However, it can be mitigated through basic solutions, such as transitioning from junk food to nutritious options and shifting from a sedentary lifestyle to an active one. By embracing these changes, we can effectively combat the problem of obesity.\n"

      "paragraph": "Many individuals argue that employers shouldn't concern themselves with how their employees dress because the quality of their work is what truly matters. However, I believe that having a clear dress code not only enhances professionalism but also plays a crucial role in promoting a harmonious work environment, aligning with the company's image, and ultimately affecting work quality.\nTo start, certain professions indeed require employees to consider their attire's impact. Frontline staff, who often interact directly with customers or guests, need to present themselves professionally. Therefore, it's essential for them to wear uniforms, signifying their professionalism. This is especially important in businesses that focus on direct client interaction, where formal attire and a dress code are integral to the organization's identity. For example, during my tenure at a renowned hotel chain, all employees, from the front desk staff to housekeepers, wore uniforms featuring the company logo. This uniformity not only instilled pride in representing the brand but also fostered a sense of unity among us, leading to improved teamwork and a shared commitment to delivering exceptional service.\nAnother rationale for implementing a dress code is that it eliminates preconceived judgments based on clothing choices, allowing employees to be assessed solely on their work merits. This cultivates a greater sense of camaraderie and common purpose among team members, as they can focus on their tasks without being distracted by clothing-related biases. Furthermore, a well-defined dress code over time creates a professional work environment by eliminating the distraction of deciding what to wear daily. In my experience at a tech startup with no dress code, I observed colleagues spending valuable time and energy debating their daily clothing choices. This often resulted in unnecessary discussions and distractions. In contrast, at another company I worked for, which had a clear dress code, employees could fully concentrate on their tasks, leading to increased productivity and a more professional atmosphere. Additionally, uniform attire can bridge social gaps between the wealthy and less privileged, enhancing the bond among employees regardless of their economic status. Therefore, uniforms convey a clear message of equality.\nIn conclusion, while one's attire or dress code at work may not directly impact productivity, its importance should be considered, depending on the nature of one's profession.\n"

While there may be varying opinions on this matter, I firmly believe that the rapid tempo and growing pressures of today's world are indeed exerting a significantly adverse influence on families.\nFirst and foremost, it is important to acknowledge that in today's professional landscape, people are confronted with increasingly demanding work schedules. Longer working hours, challenging commutes, and a strong emphasis on career advancement have become commonplace. Consequently, individuals often find themselves devoting a substantial portion of their time to their jobs. This leaves them with limited opportunities to spend quality time with their families, resulting in fewer chances for meaningful interactions and placing strain on familial relationships.\nFurthermore, the pervasive use of technology and social media exacerbates this issue. In the current digital era, people are becoming more engrossed in their smartphones, laptops, and social networking platforms. This not only hinders their ability to engage in meaningful moments with their loved ones but also disrupts face-to-face communication. As a consequence, family members may experience emotional disconnection, further amplifying the adverse impacts of the swift-paced modern lifestyle.\nAdditionally, contemporary living can be characterized by high levels of stress stemming from various factors, including financial burdens and the unrelenting pursuit of success. Regrettably, such stress can have detrimental effects on family life, leading to conflicts and tension within households. These challenges can strain relationships among partners, parents, and their children, fostering emotional distance and placing additional strain on familial bonds. It is crucial to address these stressors in order to maintain healthy family dynamics.\nIn conclusion, the rapid tempo and stressors of modern life undeniably place a strain on families. The demands of work, the allure of technology, and the burdens of stress make achieving a balance between professional and personal life a formidable challenge.

      "paragraph": "\"In some countries, secondary schools aim to provide a general education across a range of subjects. In others, children focus on a narrow range of subjects related to a particular career. Which of these two systems is more appropriate in today?? world?\"\nIn various nations, secondary education takes different approaches. Some offer a broad spectrum of subjects, while others prioritize career-focused studies. Both systems have their merits, and I acknowledge the value of a well-rounded education. However, the importance of specialized training should not be underestimated.\nStudying a diverse range of subjects offers numerous advantages. Firstly, it equips students with a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of life, enhancing their essential skills and problem-solving abilities. For instance, without a solid grasp of subjects like Mathematics or Finance, managing household finances can be daunting for individuals. Conversely, those proficient in Math may struggle to comprehend social and economic issues without exposure to social sciences. Moreover, a curriculum rich in diverse subjects can help students discover their career passions, a task often challenging during adolescence. Exposure to a wide array of subjects allows secondary school students to explore different fields of interest and make informed career choices.\nOn the other hand, I firmly believe that specialized training has its own advantages, particularly in terms of career preparation. The primary benefit is that it enables students to develop deep knowledge and skills in their chosen field, paving the way for significant professional growth. In today's highly competitive job market, having expertise in a specific career area can give young students a competitive edge. For instance, employers often prefer candidates who have graduated from schools specializing in sports-related education for coaching positions. Additionally, a focus on specific career-related subjects can free up time for students to engage in extracurricular activities, where they can refine soft skills such as teamwork, leadership, communication, and problem-solving.\nIn conclusion, while I recognize the merits of a diverse education, I contend that a specialized training system, which provides students with optimal preparation for their chosen professions, is more fitting for the modern world. Both approaches have their place, but in an increasingly competitive and specialized job market, career-focused education appears to be the more relevant choice.\n"

I believe that the primary reasons for this trend are people's innate curiosity and their high expectations for their new residences. Consequently, I recommend two key approaches to investigate this question: seeking information from local residents and utilizing online resources.\nOne significant factor driving the surge in house history research is the natural curiosity ingrained in human nature. People have an inherent desire to uncover unknown knowledge and gather as much information as possible. This curiosity motivates individuals to seek out informative and reputable sources about the history of their new homes. Additionally, the elevated expectations that residents have for their living conditions play a pivotal role.

Therefore, increasing the prices of products containing sugar could limit people's consumption. From my perspective, I strongly agree with this statement, and I will elaborate on my opinion below.\nFirst and foremost, there is no denying that sugary items may be harmful to our overall health and can lead to serious illnesses. Fast foods, sugary foods, and drinks are readily available for all age groups without much effort. For example, in the United States, there has been an acceleration in the number of people suffering from obesity, diabetes, and heart attacks due to the overconsumption of fast foods and soft drinks such as cola, fried chicken, or hamburgers. Hence, the authorities should consider imposing laws or regulations to levy taxes on these kinds of foods to make them less affordable.\nSecondly, increasing the price of these harmful foods could raise awareness of the health hazards and encourage consumers to make healthier choices. This is because people often opt for affordable and easily accessible foods and beverages. Therefore, if these goods were made more expensive, people might choose less expensive and healthier alternatives.

I wholeheartedly agree with this notion, and I'd like to elaborate on my reasons for supporting it.\nFirstly, engaging in volunteer work during their leisure time can prove highly advantageous for teenagers. When they participate in community activities, they gain valuable life experiences, becoming more resilient and mature individuals. Moreover, such activities provide them with essential social skills, like effective communication and cooperation, which cannot be learned solely from textbooks. Furthermore, instead of compelling their children to attend additional classes after rigorous study hours, parents should encourage them to partake in volunteer activities, which can help them relax and lead happier lives. As an illustration, universities often organize various volunteer opportunities for students, allowing them to confront challenges and difficulties before entering society.\nIn my view, when teenagers participate in unpaid labor, they also develop a sense of usefulness to society. Numerous individuals, such as homeless people, the elderly living in isolation, orphans, and those residing in remote areas, still require support from the younger generation. Additionally, the environment can benefit from teenagers picking up litter, leading to a cleaner and more appealing surroundings. Volunteer work also plays a role in raising public awareness and fostering a sense of responsibility.

Firstly, they can lead users to develop an addiction to the internet.

This excessive screen time often results in a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to serious health issues such as diabetes, obesity, and depression. Furthermore, excessive use of social media and prolonged online activity can be highly unproductive. Heavy users may find themselves lacking sufficient time for essential tasks and missing out on meaningful moments with their families, which is indeed regrettable.\nIn terms of the impact on society, the proliferation of social media platforms has led to a significant increase in cybercrime rates. Sophisticated criminals exploit security vulnerabilities to illegally obtain and share users' personal information.

From my perspective, implementing a dress code policy offers benefits not only to employees but also to the overall work environment.\nTo start, certain occupations are indeed influenced by one's attire. Frontline staff, such as receptionists, need to present themselves professionally when interacting with customers or guests. Consequently, it's essential for such employees to wear uniforms, signifying their professionalism. Another noteworthy example is positions involving face-to-face interactions, where one's clothing can create either favorable or unfavorable impressions. This is particularly relevant in business models centered on direct client interactions, where formal attire and a dress code play a crucial role in the organization's branding. In such cases, uniforms can also cultivate a shared sense of pride among employees. By donning similar clothing, employees may develop a stronger connection to the company, even if it's a small but necessary one. As a result, they can experience a heightened sense of belonging within the organization.\nAnother rationale for advocating uniform attire is that it eliminates preconceived notions about what to wear, fostering greater group cohesion and unity. While some argue that imposing strict dress regulations may suppress cultural identity, potentially leading to feelings of cultural erasure or employee alienation, it ultimately contributes to a more professional work environment. This approach avoids distractions associated with choosing attire and reduces concerns about outfit repetition. Additionally, having a standardized dress code diminishes social inequality between affluent and less privileged employees, strengthening the bond among all staff members, regardless of economic disparities. Consequently, uniforms convey a clear message of equality.\nIn conclusion, although one's choice of clothing or adherence to a dress code may not have a direct impact on productivity, its significance depends on the nature of the work.\n"

      "paragraph": "Educational methods are a persistent and significant concern. Some individuals argue that schools should prioritize academic achievement and exam success, while skills like cooking, dressmaking, and woodworking are better acquired through interactions with family and friends. I personally share the perspective that the primary focus should indeed be on academic excellence. Nevertheless, there may be a valid argument for incorporating certain life skills into the school curriculum due to their potential to contribute to the development of young generations.\nThe analysis and study of academic subjects hold substantial importance for students for several reasons. Core subjects such as mathematics, biology, and science provide students with a foundational knowledge base that can help young individuals, who may have limited life experience, to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities in their preferred fields. Furthermore, studying specific subjects like literature or politics can foster the development of a well-rounded mindset, facilitating individuals in their pursuit of success and prosperity. When viewed from a broader perspective, it becomes evident that most highly successful individuals on Earth have achieved their status primarily through excellent academic performance. There are only a few exceptions of individuals who have achieved significant success or fame without dedicating a substantial amount of time to academic pursuits. In summary, focusing on academic success and excelling in examinations are essential stepping stones toward realizing one's dreams.\nFrom a different perspective, even though the prevailing opinion suggests that skills such as cookery and woodworking are better acquired from family and friends rather than in schools, I would argue that there are valid reasons for students to explore these practical abilities within a school setting. Firstly, qualified teachers and instructors can serve as valuable mentors and vigilant supervisors. They not only offer a wide array of useful tips to their students but also ensure the safety of these young individuals during practical activities, a responsibility that parents or peers might not be adequately equipped to fulfill.\nIn conclusion, I partially agree with the given statement. Undoubtedly, academic success and excellence in examinations are of paramount importance. However, I believe that incorporating certain life skills into the education curriculum is a consideration worth exploring.\n"

      "paragraph": "There is an ongoing debate regarding the prohibition of dangerous sports. Some argue in favor of banning them due to safety concerns, while others believe that individuals should have the freedom to choose their sports and activities. In this essay, I will present both perspectives on this matter and express my own opinion, which supports the idea of allowing people to participate in the sports of their choice.\nOn one hand, there is a valid argument for regulating dangerous sports because they pose a significant risk to participants' lives. Minor technological errors can expose athletes to higher risks of fatalities and injuries. For example, Phansipang mountain witnesses approximately 500 accidents related to base jumping each year, resulting in 55 fatalities and 150 severe injuries. These incidents have led to the prohibition of base jumping in this area. Such bans not only have a negative impact on local tourism but also place a significant burden on the healthcare system.\nOn the other hand, despite the risks associated with extreme sports, I firmly believe that individuals should have the freedom to engage in their preferred physical activities. These sports offer valuable life lessons and skills related to bravery and commitment. Participants can apply these lessons in their everyday lives, becoming more well-rounded individuals as a result. For instance, my personal experience with skydiving in 2019 taught me how to maintain balance at great altitudes and handle emergencies effectively. These practical skills have proven useful in real-life situations.\nIn conclusion, after considering both viewpoints, I strongly assert that banning extreme sports is unnecessary. People should have the autonomy to choose their physical pursuits. While safety concerns are valid, the benefits of personal growth and skill development that these activities offer outweigh the risks.\n"

From my perspective, I tend to agree with the notion that these sites exert adverse influences on both individuals and society as a whole.\nBased on credible research and real-life situations, it becomes evident that various social media platforms, such as Facebook, have a detrimental impact on their users. Firstly, they can lead to internet addiction. In Vietnam, approximately 70% of Facebook users have confessed to spending most of their free time, and even work time, on the platform. This excessive screen time promotes a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to serious health issues like diabetes, obesity, and depression. Furthermore, prolonged use of social media and excessive online activity can be a significant time-waster. Heavy users may find themselves unable to complete essential tasks and miss out on precious moments with their families, which is truly regrettable.\nConcerning the broader community, the rise of social media platforms has coincided with a dramatic increase in cybercrime rates. High-tech criminals exploit security vulnerabilities to illicitly access and share users' information. These ill-gotten gains are then used to intimidate and extort money from victims. In some distressing cases, these victims are driven to contemplate suicide.

For instance, frontline staff such as receptionists need to appear presentable when interacting with customers or guests. Therefore, these employees should wear uniforms to demonstrate their professionalism. Another noteworthy example pertains to jobs that involve face-to-face meetings, where one's attire can create either positive or negative impressions.

Consequently, employees may feel more connected to the corporation.\nAnother rationale for endorsing uniform attire is that it eliminates preconceived notions about what to wear, promoting greater cohesion and commonality among employees. While some argue that imposing strict dress regulations might stifle cultural identity and lead to feelings of cultural erasure or alienation, potentially affecting work quality negatively, in the long run, this approach creates a professional work environment that avoids trivial issues related to clothing choices or outfit repetition.

I wholeheartedly agree with this idea and will outline several key advantages of encouraging teenagers to become involved in social service.\nFirst and foremost, it can be seen as a more meaningful use of their time. Research indicates that boredom often leads many teenagers to engage in criminal activities and substance abuse. Therefore, keeping them engaged in social endeavors, such as cleaning public areas or raising awareness about important social issues, should be strongly preferred over wasting time in unproductive pursuits to combat boredom.\nSecondly, data suggests that community service plays a vital role in the character development of teenagers. For instance, if a teenager takes part in cleaning their local streets, they will come to appreciate the significance of cleanliness and hygiene. Consequently, this will contribute to the formation of a society populated by morally upright adolescents.\nThirdly, it can help teenagers acquire valuable skills and understand how to function in a work environment. Consequently, students will gain prior work experience before entering the job market, making them better prepared for their future careers.\nTo realize this vision, there are two key approaches. Initially, students should be offered various incentives, such as receiving credits for their university applications when they engage in community service. Additionally, educators and parents should raise awareness about the valuable experiences that teenagers can gain from participating in such activities.\nIn conclusion, there are virtually no downsides to promoting unpaid social work among teenagers within their own communities. I hope that these ideas are considered and implemented by the government in the near future for the betterment of our society.\n"

      "paragraph": "According to some experts, it is suggested that road cyclists should undergo an assessment before being allowed to ride on public roads. While a number of people believe that it has some benefits, I firmly hold the view that adopting a rider policy has greater drawbacks.\nFirst and foremost, mandatory tests for road cyclists would enhance safety on public roads. To explain, individuals who ride bicycles should have a broad understanding of traffic laws and road rules to ride a bicycle safely and obey the regulations. For instance, in a report studied in a department in the USA, people who have cleared the road safety test for cycling have a 30% lower chance of road mishaps than others. This can consequently reduce the likelihood of road accidents caused by factors such as improper signaling and not following traffic lights. By comparison, those who engage in cycling do not have comprehensive knowledge of traffic laws, which leads to a higher rate of accidents.\nHowever, this policy can lead to a decline in the number of people riding. As many people participate in cycling in their leisure time to reduce stress and improve their health. A survey conducted in 2021 in England has indicated that around 80% of bike riders partake in cycling because they want to improve their health and relieve stress. As a result, demonstrating their cycling ability in a test may be considered time-consuming for them, and many will turn to other effective forms to enhance their well-being like jogging and walking.\nTo conclude, implementing the riding policy can make the number of cyclists expected to significantly decrease as their primary purpose is mainly for health and fitness training. However, the awareness of people's road regulations is increasingly being reinforced. Thus, my view is that the drawbacks are greater. It is therefore imperative for the authorities to conduct thorough research before putting it into practice.\n"

The purpose of this essay is to explore the advantages and disadvantages of this transformation.\nOn the positive side, the progress in technology offers various benefits to the way people work today. One of the standout advantages is the enhanced productivity and efficiency it brings. This is because time-consuming and previously labor-intensive tasks can now be completed swiftly and effectively thanks to the development of digital tools, software, and systems. Consequently, employers can allocate more attention to critical tasks that generate income and promote business growth. Moreover, owing to the rise of remote work, employees have the flexibility to fulfill their tasks from the comfort of their own homes or any other location. Consequently, they can work in a more relaxed environment, leading to increased productivity and better stress management.\nHowever, technological advancement also has negative impacts on the modern workplace. To begin with, technology can be a source of distraction during work. Many employees and workers tend to get sidetracked by modern technology devices while on the job. For instance, they might use technology for entertainment, such as watching videos or playing games, which could result in time wastage. Furthermore, employers may become overly reliant on the use of modern technology. With easy access to information on the internet, they might start depending on technology rather than utilizing their own skills and abilities.

While some proponents argue that prohibiting the use of these digital devices greatly enhances driver safety and protects their belongings, opponents contend that such a ban is unjustified given the functions and entertainment that phones offer to drivers.\nFirstly, it is widely believed that refraining from using a phone while driving can significantly improve driver safety. This is because drivers are less distracted by their devices, allowing them to concentrate more on the road and reduce the risk of serious traffic accidents. According to a report in The New York Times, the majority of annual car accidents are attributed to driver inattention. Additionally, another reason to support a cell phone ban is the reduction in theft and crime. Using a phone while driving can make it easier for thieves to steal or forcibly snatch it from drivers' hands. Consequently, drivers may lose their valuable phones and even sustain severe injuries.\nOn the contrary, critics argue that phones can have some useful features for drivers when navigating traffic. For example, phone apps like GPS can provide precise directions for those who are lost. Furthermore, phone-based entertainment can help alleviate frustration during heavy traffic congestion. Traffic jams are increasingly common nowadays and can lead to frustration among drivers. Therefore, features like music playback on a phone can help drivers relax and reduce their annoyance, promoting a more positive driving experience.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that banning the use of cell phones while driving should be encouraged to ensure drivers focus on their safety and protect their belongings.

Several factors contribute to this trend, and in this essay, I will examine these factors and their implications for individuals and society at large.\nTo begin with, one primary reason for this decline is that people nowadays dedicate the majority of their time to their work, leaving them with limited opportunities to engage in hobbies. For instance, individuals often pursue their career ambitions relentlessly, which leads them to persist in their work, even when faced with demanding tasks, leaving little room for leisure pursuits. Furthermore, some view indulging in hobbies as a time-wasting endeavor. For example, in competitive work environments, such as those found in certain international companies in Vietnam, ambitious employees believe that prioritizing their career prospects and increasing their income takes precedence over leisure activities.\nThis shift in lifestyle can have adverse effects on individuals. Firstly, it may lead to feelings of depression and fatigue. When individuals commit the majority of their time to work without adequate relaxation, it can result in unexpected mental health issues. These issues not only detrimentally affect their psychological well-being but also have a negative impact on their performance in the workplace. Additionally, the lack of engagement in hobbies hinders people from connecting with one another, reducing opportunities for social interaction and community engagement. Consequently, this can strain interpersonal relationships within specific regions.\nIn conclusion, the decline in the participation of leisure activities can be attributed to various factors and has far-reaching consequences. Therefore, it is imperative for each individual to carefully consider the potential negative repercussions of this trend and strive to strike a balance between work and leisure to mitigate these issues.\n"

This essay will explore both perspectives and demonstrate that, from my point of view, the former idea is more convincing.\nOn one hand, the significant disparity in income between leaders of large enterprises and regular employees may seem unfair to some individuals. Firstly, employees are required to work diligently. To be specific, many of them are dedicated and allocate a significant amount of their time to work. Consequently, they might believe they deserve to be compensated at a level equal to that of their executives. However, it is important to note that the value of a worker cannot be solely determined by how hard they work. Otherwise, a large number of laborers would receive substantial monetary compensation because they work extremely hard.\nOn the other hand, it appears reasonable that high-level directors receive a higher monthly salary than typical staff. Firstly, they tend to have significant responsibilities in making decisions closely related to the success or failure of their businesses, as these decisions can have both lucrative and disastrous consequences if not carefully considered. Furthermore, replacing them is often impractical due to their leadership qualities and, in most cases, their competence as well. For instance, even if staff members may be more skilled than their bosses in a particular profession, they cannot effectively run an entire business as proficiently as their managers due to their lack of leadership abilities. Consequently, they deserve to receive a more substantial sum than their employees.\nIn conclusion, while there are valid arguments supporting the idea of maintaining salary equality in large businesses, I believe that offering higher salaries to leaders is necessary to retain talent and ensure the effective management of large organizations.\n"

From my perspective, I partially agree with the given statement. While it is true that the government should invest more funds in improving society, utilizing money to explore the cosmos is not necessarily a waste.\nOn the one hand, discovering life on other planets can still provide benefits to humanity. Earth is becoming increasingly polluted, and there is a scarcity of vital resources such as fresh water and precious metals like gold. Therefore, scientists should explore other planets to find a suitable alternative for human habitation in case Earth becomes uninhabitable. For example, greater financial support should be allocated to astronauts for more space missions to Mars. Mars is widely believed to possess fresh water and other valuable resources similar to Earth. Investigating the potential for human life on Mars is crucial, and governments should provide scientists with more funding to further this research for the benefit of their citizens.\nOn the other hand, there are valid reasons to argue that authorities should allocate more funds to address current societal problems rather than focusing solely on distant future possibilities. Many people still lack access to basic necessities like clean water and proper education due to poverty, leading to a host of additional issues, including high mortality rates and increased crime.

In my view, this trend has more benefits than challenges and can contribute to the world?? sustainable development.\nOn the one hand, the switch to alternative forms of energy may bring about drawbacks for countries. This can be explained through substantial financial implications for governments and corporations. Specifically, a large number of investments are needed to acquire and establish new equipment and facilities, which may lead to substantial debts for the national budget or executing companies. Moreover, the large-scale production of solar panels remains costly, which is unattainable for economically challenged nations. In fact, the shift towards sustainable energy can be a burden for countries that are under tight budgets and have other concerns such as investing in education systems, road facilities, or public transportation systems.\nOn the other hand, the positive effects are considerable and bring various advantageous developments. First, fossil fuels obviously contribute to air pollution as they release enormous amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, leading to severe environmental consequences. Thus, alternative sources of energy act as cleaner alternatives which substantially curtail emissions. Second, fossil fuels are finite and increasingly become depleted over time. Therefore, it is vital to advance renewable energy solutions to gradually supplant traditional sources to contribute to overall sustainable development.\nIn conclusion, the adoption of alternative energy options may have negative effects on nations.

Balancing the advantages and disadvantages of risk-taking is essential, and individuals should approach it with careful consideration and planning to ensure the best possible outcomes in their endeavors.\n"

      "question": "Which is the better way to learn about history: written documents or films and videos?",
      "paragraph": "In today's era of technological advancements, accessing written documents and historical films and videos has become increasingly convenient. This has sparked a debate regarding the preferred method of learning about history, with some advocating for visual media over written records. While there are merits to both approaches, I firmly support the notion that written documents should hold greater significance in the study of the past.\nOne primary advantage of utilizing films and video records is their ability to convey a heightened sense of authenticity and offer a more engaging learning experience. For instance, students can gain a deeper comprehension of historical events by watching re-enactments rather than solely relying on written descriptions. This visual impact is further enriched when accompanied by a narrator providing additional context. Hence, it is evident that this multimedia format can significantly enhance the educational journey.\nNevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent limitations of this mode of learning. One notable drawback is that films and video narratives often have a biased agenda, aiming to elicit specific reactions from the audience, particularly when sponsored by organizations with vested interests. Moreover, the accuracy of a video record hinges on the knowledge and intentions of its creators, rendering the information potentially unreliable.\nIn contrast, written documents are inherently more objective and amenable to verification through independent sources. This is especially pertinent when examining historical accounts, as textual accuracy can be corroborated using various methods. For instance, diaries and letters can be cross-referenced with contemporaneous documents, a level of scrutiny that is not feasible with video records, lacking mechanisms for verification.\nIn conclusion, while films and video records offer an engaging and captivating means of exploring the past, I am convinced that written documents remain the most dependable source of information. They provide a more objective medium, subject to validation through diverse means. Consequently, I advocate for affording written documents greater prominence in historical studies.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's society, homelessness is a topic that sparks intense debates. Some argue that governments should provide free housing for those who cannot afford it, seeing it as a basic human right. However, I believe that while making sure everyone has housing is important, a complete solution involves more than just free housing when we think about how complex this issue is.\nCertainly, there is a portion of society that includes the elderly, disabled individuals, and orphaned children who cannot find suitable housing due to their vulnerable situations. For these disadvantaged groups, government intervention is necessary to protect their basic human rights and promote fairness in society. Furthermore, offering free housing to those who need it the most can potentially reduce crime rates and create a sense of community, which can contribute to overall social stability and global prosperity. Additionally, government investments in housing projects can stimulate job creation, reduce unemployment rates, and encourage charitable activities on a national level.\nHowever, it is crucial to recognize the potential downsides of unrestricted free housing. Firstly, without strict management and supervision, these housing services may be open to misuse, with management teams misusing public funds instead of helping those in need. Secondly, relying entirely on government assistance may discourage individuals from seeking employment and self-sufficiency, which could impede economic growth and societal progress. Lastly, the substantial budget allocated to free housing could be redirected toward urgent national priorities such as education and defense.\nIn conclusion, while the concept of free housing has clear benefits in addressing homelessness and enhancing social unity, it should be implemented carefully with strong oversight. A more comprehensive solution to this multifaceted issue requires a well-balanced approach that takes into account the diverse needs of society, while also ensuring responsible financial management and giving priority to other essential national concerns.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's world, it is undeniable that environmental issues have become a paramount global concern. Many individuals advocate for a potential solution to these challenges by suggesting an increase in the price of gasoline. From my personal perspective, I concur that while this may prove to be an effective measure, there are also valid reasons why alternative approaches may yield greater benefits.\nOn the one hand, this proposed solution can address multiple environmental issues due to its inherent advantages. Firstly, with regard to automobiles, raising the price of gasoline would curtail the number of car journeys, prompting individuals who cannot afford higher fuel costs to opt for walking or utilizing public transportation. This, in turn, might lead the government to allocate more funds towards improving public transport systems such as buses and trains to cater to the commuting needs of citizens heading to school or work. Additionally, as the cost of gasoline rises, a greater volume of goods may be transported by rail rather than trucks. These advantages would contribute to a reduction in emissions from vehicles, consequently mitigating the greenhouse effect.\nOn the other hand, I maintain that increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles represents just one facet of addressing this global predicament and may not be suitable in the long run. For example, London implemented a congestion charge for all vehicles entering the city center, resulting in a decrease in traffic within the city center, albeit sometimes leading to traffic congestion on the outskirts. Another policy approach could involve the introduction of free bus and train services. This strategy not only facilitates long-distance travel for people facing financial constraints but also proves environmentally beneficial, aligning with efforts to combat global warming.\n"

While some oppose this approach due to its perceived cruelty, I believe that animal experiments should be accepted because of the potential benefits they offer.\nOn one hand, those who are against animal experimentation advocate for a ban because animals experience suffering and pain during the experimental process. Initially, animals are often removed from their natural habitats and confined to small cages. They are then subjected to injections of various medicines or vaccines without consideration for potential side effects. Additionally, these animals may be dissected to assess the effects of new medicines on their organs. This means that, in pursuit of advancements in new medications, animal lives are sometimes sacrificed.\nOn the other hand, I argue that people should have a deeper understanding of animal experimentation. To start with, many individuals suffering from chronic diseases eagerly await new medicines that may result from animal testing. Furthermore, animal testing can help ensure the safety of new medicines that could otherwise pose significant risks to human well-being. Finally, certain mammals, such as mice or dogs, share common features in terms of body structure, making them valuable subjects for scientific research related to the human body.\nIn conclusion, I acknowledge that animal testing can lead to suffering for the subjects involved.

However, I firmly disagree with this assertion because wild animals have the right to live, and the diversity of animals benefits the ecosystem that sustains all life on Earth.\nTo begin with, it is unreasonable to argue that wild animals have no role in the modern world. Our planet is home to a multitude of beings, including humans, animals, and plants, and Earth does not exist solely for the benefit of humans. Therefore, people cannot exploit the Earth, harm the habitats of countless wild animals, and then claim that there is no space for them. Furthermore, there is no compelling reason to allow them to go extinct. Throughout history, humans and wild animals have coexisted on this planet, and this should remain our goal in the future. In fact, in today's world, we possess the technology to cultivate crops without traditional planting methods and the capability to construct towering skyscrapers in compact spaces. Therefore, why should we destroy natural habitats and disrupt the homes of wild animals?\nI also oppose the idea of not protecting wild animals. Firstly, preserving and safeguarding them contributes to the preservation of biodiversity on Earth. This not only enriches our lives by providing a diverse and captivating environment but is also vital for the survival of humanity. I firmly believe that if we do not protect and ensure a secure existence for wild animals, it will be a significant loss for future generations because they will miss out on the opportunity to witness the beauty and diversity of various creatures on this planet. Finally, by conserving wild animals, biologists and scientists will have valuable resources for conducting in-depth research on the origin and evolution of life on Earth.\nIn conclusion, I advocate for a harmonious coexistence between wild animals and humans in the 21st century. It is imperative to protect them rather than allowing them to perish.\n"

For instance, individuals often listen to music and engage in lively activities, such as going to casinos or bars. Others turn to music to navigate challenging emotional periods, such as following a painful divorce or the loss of a beloved family member. Additionally, for some, music represents a humanly crafted creative endeavor aimed at harmonizing voices or instrumental melodies to convey emotional sentiments.

From my perspective, I strongly support this viewpoint.\nOn one hand, I believe that businesses must prioritize their income in order to ensure their survival and growth in today's world. Firstly, companies are faced with various operational costs, including expenses for materials, utilities, wages, and buildings, all of which are crucial to maintaining their daily operations. Additionally, investments in research, marketing, and innovation play a pivotal role in improving the quality of products and services. For instance, in the technology sector, companies like Apple allocate substantial resources to research and development, leading to the creation of innovative products like the iPhone. This not only boosts their profits but also keeps them competitive in the market. If a business aims to achieve success and make a meaningful contribution to the community, it must establish a strong financial foundation. This means that supporting society is imperative, as it would be futile and inconsequential if these companies cannot afford their daily operating expenses.\nOn the other hand, businesses are not only responsible for enhancing their profits but also for fulfilling their social obligations. In my view, a willingness to support society helps companies build and maintain their credibility, ultimately attracting and retaining a large customer base. Moreover, business owners must prioritize the well-being of their employees. Many successful companies, such as Google, offer comprehensive employee benefits, including free meals, wellness programs, and childcare facilities. This not only improves employee retention but also enhances the company's reputation as a socially responsible employer. Furthermore, a portion of the profits should be allocated to support local charities, SOS villages, and environmental projects, all of which contribute to improving the quality of life in society.\nIn conclusion, whether a business is small or large, it should allocate sufficient resources to fulfill its social responsibilities towards both its employees and the wider community.\n"

In my view, I wholeheartedly agree with this perspective.\nOn one hand, there are several compelling reasons why many people believe that clothing is no longer a pressing issue. The primary reason is that workers typically only need to wear formal attire, as extravagant costumes are unnecessary. Consider office workers, for instance; in such an elegant working environment, a pair of jeans and a shirt or T-shirt suffices. Another justification for this stance is the paramount importance of work quality. If managers invest their time in enhancing the quality of work rather than monitoring their employees' attire, there will undoubtedly be a substantial improvement in work quality, which can yield various benefits for the company.\nOn the other hand, while there may be some advantages to paying attention to clothing, the drawbacks become more evident in specific cases. For companies primarily operating online, concerns about attire become irrelevant. In fact, employees in such situations often work from home, where they can wear comfortable clothing of their choice. Additionally, focusing on attire can perpetuate cultural discrimination. Many employees come from diverse backgrounds within a company, resulting in a wide range of cultural expressions.

In my view, this development carries both advantages and disadvantages for family relationships.\nModern technology has a positive impact on family ties in various ways, such as facilitating communication and providing convenience in caring for family members, even when one is engrossed in work or studies. Additionally, it contributes to a more contemporary and enriched family lifestyle. For instance, consider a scenario where a student is pursuing education abroad, necessitating physical separation from their family. Undoubtedly, technology offers the swiftest means of connecting with family members, enabling them to engage in conversations and inquire about each other's well-being. I believe this is a prevalent practice among international students, as technology serves as a platform for expressing affection, love, and homesickness toward their family.\nConversely, this development can also yield substantial disadvantages. Firstly, the proliferation of social networks may lead children to seek information from friends or even strangers instead of turning to their parents, potentially compromising their privacy by divulging personal details. Secondly, technology has the propensity to create emotional distance within the family. With the ease of sending messages, family members may find themselves communicating through screens even when they are physically together at home, during meal times, or at family gatherings. Both parents and children can be guilty of this behavior, resulting in feelings of detachment and diminished importance among family members. Lastly, the overreliance on technology can erode the sense of comfort, trust, and love within the family. When face-to-face interactions become rare and family members are not fully present during moments of connection, it can weaken the bonds between them. This lack of genuine communication and sharing can undermine a child's confidence, as their parents may fail to understand their needs and offer support.\nIn conclusion, while technology undoubtedly enhances various aspects of our lives, it is essential for families to recognize the need to balance its use with maintaining meaningful connections among their members. Technology should not serve as a barrier, limiting the time spent together or creating emotional distance. Nurture the bonds with loved ones by prioritizing genuine face-to-face interactions.\n"

This trend can be attributed to various reasons, but I personally view it as a negative development.\nOn one hand, this phenomenon can be explained by two main factors. Firstly, it is undeniable that having an attractive appearance holds considerable importance in social and professional contexts. People naturally gravitate towards individuals with ideal facial features or body shapes, forming favorable impressions, which is especially crucial in today's interconnected world where interpersonal relationships play a vital role. Furthermore, the emphasis on beauty has grown due to the improved living standards of humanity. This shift can be largely attributed to the fact that people no longer face the same survival or food-related concerns that were predominant in the past.\nOn the other hand, I firmly believe that this trend has several noticeable negative consequences. While plastic surgery can offer benefits, it also entails both physical and psychological risks. In terms of physical effects, patients undergo a lengthy and often painful process, with no guarantee of success. Additionally, they may experience embarrassment and social isolation if the operation fails to yield the desired results. Moreover, cosmetic surgery comes at a substantial financial cost, which can place a significant burden on the patient's budget, especially if they are dissatisfied with the outcome. These resources could be better utilized to address other essential needs such as education, employment, or housing, rather than being solely dedicated to enhancing one's appearance.\nIn conclusion, the societal pressure to conform to beauty standards has fueled the popularity of the cosmetic surgery industry.

While some argue that the traditional model of a teacher and students won't exist, and instead, there will be virtual classes by 2050, I respectfully disagree with this viewpoint.\nOn one hand, the prediction holds some merit due to the influence of technology on education. Firstly, online learning platforms have become globally accessible, allowing students to connect from anywhere in the world. Consequently, students have become more self-reliant in their learning. Additionally, artificial intelligence can provide parents with feedback on their children's academic performance. This exceptional performance by AI might suggest that teachers are no longer necessary.\nOn the other hand, I firmly believe that the traditional teaching environment will persist. Firstly, the conventional classroom model remains crucial in children's education. For instance, young learners need physical teachers to help them make sense of the world at their tender age. Likewise, when they encounter difficulties in their studies or in life, they can seek guidance and advice from their teachers. Secondly, this model facilitates effective interaction between teachers and students. When students struggle with certain skills, teachers are eager to assist them in overcoming those challenges.

This essay aims to discuss two primary reasons for this issue and propose a solution to help mitigate its negative impact.\nDigital communication platforms can undermine the depth of personal interactions for two main reasons. Firstly, face-to-face conversations have been replaced by text messages and social media posts, which lack the richness of nonverbal cues and emotional nuances. For example, emojis can hardly replace the warmth of a genuine smile during a conversation, which can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations in text-based communication. Secondly, social media often showcases idealized versions of people's lives, emphasizing only the positive aspects while concealing struggles and imperfections. This can create feelings of inadequacy and insecurity among individuals, leading them to compare their relationships to those portrayed online. For instance, a person may feel dissatisfied with their own relationship because it does not seem as glamorous or exciting as what they see on social media.\nHowever, it is important to note that social media and technology can also strengthen relationships by facilitating connections over long distances and providing a platform for shared interests.

If people have access to many sports facilities, they will have the motivation to engage in physical activities such as playing badminton or football, which can contribute to their overall well-being. Moreover, they can build strong relationships with like-minded individuals who share a desire to improve their health and play sports together. Consequently, it is argued that having many facilities can lead to improved health.\nHowever, from a personal perspective, I do not believe that people who have access to many sports facilities can necessarily improve themselves for two main reasons. Firstly, if individuals have access to an abundance of facilities, they may end up spending excessive time on sports activities, which could lead to unnecessary expenses that may not be worthwhile in the long run. Secondly, having an excess of sports facilities might demotivate individuals, causing them to be unsure of what sports to engage in, ultimately hindering their progress. This is why I do not agree with the idea of solely relying on sports facilities to improve public health.\nDespite the aforementioned arguments, I side with those who advocate for alternative measures to enhance public health.

These activities are cost-effective and can be integrated into one's daily routine, saving both money and time.

Furthermore, when governments establish reserves for animals and employ veterinarians for their care, biodiversity can make a swift comeback.\nSecondly, wild animals exert a positive influence on a country's agriculture. Take, for instance, predators like wolves, tigers, and lions, which prey on herbivores, thereby assisting in regulating plant and grass growth. Additionally, wild animals consume harmful insects that can damage farmers' crops, thus safeguarding not only the crops but also enhancing farmers' profits when they sell their produce.\nNevertheless, some opponents may argue that there is insufficient space for wild animals in the 21st century, making the allocation of resources for their protection seem wasteful. The challenges of overpopulation have forced people to clear forests and expand urban areas for housing and apartments. Consequently, if overpopulation continues to surge, people might struggle to secure enough food sources for both themselves and other animals.\nIn conclusion, animals occupy a pivotal role in our world, benefiting not only our lives but also our environment. Devoid of wild animals, our ability to coexist in this world would be severely compromised. It is our solemn duty to safeguard and conserve the natural environment and the wildlife that inhabits it, ensuring a better world for future generations.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's modern society, financial well-being holds a prominent role in our lives. The acquisition of wealth can significantly influence our lifestyle, making it clear why many individuals prioritize salary when selecting a job. Nonetheless, there still exists a segment of people who pursue work for the sheer joy it brings and the freedom it offers.\nIn my view, as society continues to advance, the cost of living also rises, necessitating a diligent approach to earning a livelihood. This becomes particularly evident when seeking employment within established companies, especially those with foreign investments. Such companies often reward dedicated employees with substantial salaries. Additionally, individuals possessing intelligence and effective managerial skills tend to secure high-paying positions within these organizations.\nIn certain instances, individuals with unique hobbies, talents, or physical attractiveness can attain fame and a substantial income through their pursuits. However, it's important to note that some individuals remain indifferent to monetary gain. Their primary focus lies in the personal satisfaction derived from their work, the stress relief it provides, and the sense of accomplishment it brings.\nIn summary, considering the financial aspect of a job is undeniably crucial in today's world. I firmly believe that salary should be a significant factor in the job selection process. Nevertheless, I also hold in high regard the importance of motivation, inspiration, and passion as influential factors in one's choice of occupation, alongside the financial considerations made by individuals of varying preferences.\n"

      "question": "What is the best approach to reducing crime rates?",
      "paragraph": "Nowadays, crime rates are on the rise, and there is an ongoing debate about the best approaches to address this issue. This discussion has divided citizens into two groups. While the majority believes that longer prison sentences are the most effective solution, others argue that alternative methods should be explored and implemented.\nTo begin with, extended periods of incarceration can be a practical and effective means of removing criminals from society. The prospect of a lengthy prison sentence can serve as a psychological deterrent, dissuading individuals from engaging in criminal activities. For instance, individuals contemplating criminal actions may think twice when they consider the bleak prospects of a life behind bars. This is especially pertinent for crimes such as murder, rape, or arson, which are characterized by malicious intent and warrant severe penalties. Therefore, longer prison terms can play a pivotal role in reducing crime rates.\nHowever, it is essential to acknowledge that long-term imprisonment may not always be the optimal solution. Criminals are human beings, capable of adapting to various circumstances, whether big or small. Prolonged periods of incarceration can lead to feelings of guilt and increased aggression. Conversely, establishing rehabilitation centers or offering vocational training can enable criminals to engage in productive activities. This approach not only promotes productivity but also fosters adaptability and positive life changes.\nIn conclusion, while lengthy prison sentences can effectively deter individuals from committing crimes, a more comprehensive strategy involves altering the perception of criminals and providing them with opportunities to develop productive skills. I firmly believe that offering alternative paths for rehabilitation and personal growth is preferable to sentencing individuals to long-term imprisonment, as it allows them to contribute positively to society rather than simply serving time.\n"

      "paragraph": "Crime is a pressing issue that demands national attention, and governments worldwide are actively seeking solutions. While some advocate for extended prison sentences as the most effective method to curb crime, others argue for alternative, more impactful approaches. This essay supports the notion that alternatives to incarceration, such as education and economic empowerment, can be more beneficial. Both perspectives will be explored in this essay.\nFirstly, many individuals believe that criminals should receive lengthier prison terms as a deterrent. This viewpoint likely arises from a concern for victims who have either witnessed unlawful acts or experienced their detrimental effects. Essentially, the rationale behind this perspective is to send a clear message to potential wrongdoers in the hopes of reducing further criminal activity.\nNevertheless, I contend that alternative strategies, such as establishing accessible educational programs and employment opportunities, can address these challenges more effectively. Sending a message may not be as potent as offering hope to individuals who have gone astray. To delve deeper, governments should prioritize education to raise awareness about legal avenues for self-improvement. A boost in self-confidence could inspire them to embark on a more positive path.\nIn conclusion, longer prison sentences undeniably instill fear in potential offenders, dissuading them from engaging in criminal acts. However, in my view, it is more advantageous to eliminate the root causes of crime by providing education and economic prospects.\n"

      "paragraph": "The global challenge of providing food for an ever-expanding world population has led to discussions about potential solutions, with some suggesting Genetically Modified (GM) foods as an answer. In this essay, I will explain why I disagree with this viewpoint. While GM foods may seem like a promising solution, I have concerns about their safety and the availability of alternative sustainable methods.\nTo begin, GM foods involve altering the genetic makeup of organisms to enhance desirable traits, like higher crop yields or resistance to pests. Although this sounds beneficial, there are potential risks. For instance, GM crops might accidentally contain allergens or toxins, which could harm consumers. Moreover, releasing genetically modified organisms into the environment may disrupt natural ecosystems and harm biodiversity.\nFurthermore, the promotion of GM foods can divert attention and resources from more sustainable agricultural practices that could address food security issues without compromising safety. Approaches such as crop rotation, agroforestry, and integrated pest management offer eco-friendly alternatives to intensive monocultures and chemical-based farming. These methods support soil health, conserve water, and preserve biodiversity, all essential for long-term food production sustainability.\nIn conclusion, while the world's growing population demands innovative food security solutions, I do not believe that GM foods provide a viable remedy. The potential risks to human health and the environment, along with the availability of more sustainable agricultural practices, make me skeptical about the long-term effectiveness of genetically modified foods. Instead of relying solely on GM foods, it is crucial to explore diverse and sustainable approaches that prioritize both human well-being and the planet's health.\n"

Therefore, some people are of the opinion that the most effective way to decrease the proportion of crime is to incarcerate criminals for longer periods. However, a more compelling argument is that there are several alternative ways to resolve this situation.\nOn the one hand, some believe that extended periods of imprisonment can be effective. Indeed, spending a longer time behind bars can reduce crime because the culprits are unable to reoffend and commit additional crimes. Take notorious murderers and scammers, for example; their crimes have caused a significant amount of harm in individuals' lives, especially their victims who have suffered terrible experiences. Therefore, sentencing such individuals to life imprisonment can make people feel safer and ensure that they can go outside without fear. Consequently, criminals who are incarcerated for an extended period can contribute to increasing happiness and a sense of security in the community.\nOn the other hand, instead of giving longer prison sentences, there are more effective alternatives to reduce the crime rate. Governments should implement stricter security policies. For instance, police officers and guards responsible for protecting the lives of local residents should undergo advanced training to enhance their ability to apprehend criminals effectively. Additionally, authorities should encourage people to install security devices such as emergency alarms, CCTV cameras, or other technical devices used to deter thieves. These initiatives not only decrease the occurrence of crime but also improve the protection of human life.\nIn conclusion, while it is evident that prisoners must be given longer sentences, I firmly believe that there are plenty of effective ways to address crime prevention to a certain extent.\n"

In my opinion, I agree with this viewpoint, and I will explain my reasons below.\nFirstly, the clothes that employees wear have no impact on the quality of their work. In fact, imposing strict dress codes can stifle creativity and make employees feel uncomfortable or restricted. For instance, some companies in Vietnam require their staff to wear uniforms while working. This can discourage employees from expressing their ideas freely and hinder their creative process, ultimately leading to delays in innovation.\nMoreover, excessive focus on employee attire can lead to unforeseen problems. If employees perceive their employer's dress code policies as unreasonable, they may rebel or undermine their supervisors, which can negatively affect the quality of the products or services they provide. This, in turn, can result in a decline in the number of potential customers. Additionally, some employees may even leave their jobs, leading to a shortage of staff in certain areas.\nIn conclusion, I believe that it is not a wise approach for employers to dictate their employees' clothing choices in the workplace.

This development has sparked debates about whether it is a positive or negative change. It is clear that both younger and older generations are inclined to use high-tech devices during their free time. While there are some advantages to this practice, it also comes with notable drawbacks.\nOn the positive side, employing advanced technology during leisure hours can have modest benefits. One advantage is that many individuals turn to technology as a means of relieving stress after long hours of work. This can be attributed to the growing global population, which intensifies competition in job markets. As a result, people experience greater pressure in their work to achieve success and maintain their living standards. Therefore, using technology for relaxation alongside their work commitments can help individuals maintain a healthy work-life balance.\nHowever, the use of advanced technology also carries significant disadvantages that outweigh the benefits. The most apparent issue is that technological advancements often introduce forms of entertainment that can distract individuals from their academic or professional pursuits. This is particularly noticeable among young people who are drawn to smartphone or laptop games. Some of these games require strategic planning and can consume excessive amounts of time. For instance, games like League of Legends often have battles lasting for a minimum of approximately 40 minutes, and quitting mid-game results in penalties. Consequently, individuals may spend hours engrossed in gaming, not only for entertainment but also to achieve in-game accomplishments. This can significantly impact their productivity in studies or work.\nIn conclusion, while there are potential advantages to using advanced technology for relaxation during leisure time, these benefits are overshadowed by the drawbacks associated with technology dependence.

Consequently, some argue that schools and parents share the responsibility for addressing this problem. In my view, I strongly concur with this assertion, believing that they must implement substantial measures to combat this phenomenon.\nFirst and foremost, it is widely acknowledged that many young individuals face challenges in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. They often find preparing nutritious meals to be difficult, time-consuming, and sometimes costly. Consequently, fast-food establishments or snacks become their preferred choices when they experience hunger due to the convenience they offer. Furthermore, some children harbor a distaste for vegetables, citing their appearance and flavor as deterrents. Consequently, they gravitate towards more enticing and flavorful food options, such as fried chicken or chips.\nI firmly believe that both parents and schools must take proactive steps to prevent this situation. Parents should encourage their children to engage in more physical activity and, if possible, participate in sports with them during their free time. Additionally, providing a sufficient quantity of vegetables and fruits should be considered by parents who aim to promote their children's overall fitness and well-being. On the other hand, schools should incorporate regular exercise opportunities into the daily routine so that students can devote time to enhancing their physical strength through activities like sports or ordinary exercise during break times.\nIn conclusion, parents and teachers possess a deep understanding of their children's needs and habits.

In my perspective, however, a more compelling argument lies in the notion that manufacturers and shopping malls should prioritize producing products that are both suitable for consumers and environmentally friendly.\nOn one hand, there are valid reasons why some people advocate for the responsibility of consumers to select products with minimal packaging, particularly those packaged in plastic or nylon bags. When such packaging is discarded into the environment, it cannot be easily recycled, leading to pollution and posing challenges in decomposition. For instance, it can take anywhere from 400 to 1000 years for a plastic bag to break down, despite its small size. Furthermore, as the number of people buying packaged products continues to rise, the potential consequences for the environment become increasingly severe.\nOn the other hand, I firmly believe that manufacturers and shopping malls should take the initiative to offer products that cater to the needs of their customers while being environmentally conscious. These entities introduce new products into various markets, including supermarkets, local markets, and convenience stores, and as such, they bear the responsibility of safeguarding the rights of consumers. It is imperative that they thoroughly assess the quality and materials used in their products, especially in the case of fast food, which often involves excessive plastic packaging. For example, every time I indulge in fast food, I am dismayed by the excessive use of plastic packaging.\nIn conclusion, I hold a strong conviction that manufacturers and shopping malls should prioritize the production of products that align with consumer needs and are environmentally friendly.

Relying on indiscriminate sources of knowledge may lead children to misunderstand concepts and learn in a disorganized manner. To illustrate this point, there is evidence suggesting that exposure to misinformation can have negative effects on children, causing them to engage in age-inappropriate and even violent behaviors. Consequently, children can become psychologically vulnerable, posing risks to themselves and those around them.\nFurthermore, schools serve a vital role in our society that cannot be easily replaced. They serve as not only educational institutions but also as places where children learn how to acquire knowledge in a selective and systematic manner. Moreover, schools facilitate the development of social skills and proper behavior by providing opportunities for interaction with teachers and peers. For instance, teachers organize activities that teach children how to treat others with respect, make new friends, and collaborate effectively in group settings. As a result, these interactions not only make learning enjoyable but also enhance children's overall mindset.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that schools play an immensely important role in education.

Firstly, dedicating a significant amount of time to this pursuit can be demanding, which may not be feasible for everyone, especially blue-collar and white-collar workers confined to specific job locations. In fact, they may struggle to allocate time for exercise due to their work commitments. Another valid explanation lies in the financial aspect, as people need to invest in improving their lifestyle through expenses like food and suitable equipment.

While this plan has evident benefits, such as supporting rural growth and alleviating urban traffic, it is crucial to consider the potential downsides. Personally, I believe that if this relocation is carried out with thoughtful planning and consideration, the advantages can outweigh any drawbacks.\nEncouraging businesses and industries to move to rural areas brings various benefits. It can contribute to rural development and address the issue of urban overcrowding. Cities often grapple with heavy traffic, pollution, and high living costs. Shifting industries to rural regions can distribute economic opportunities more evenly and relieve the strain on urban resources. This can lead to improved living conditions for city residents and a fairer distribution of wealth and resources throughout the country.\nMoreover, relocating industries to rural areas can provide a substantial economic boost to these communities. It can create additional job opportunities and prevent people from migrating from rural to urban areas, thereby curbing overpopulation in major cities. This can also rejuvenate the rural economy and foster sustainable development in regions that are frequently overlooked in favor of cities.\nHowever, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential downsides of this strategy. One issue to consider is its impact on the environment. Rural industries must adhere to stringent environmental regulations to avoid pollution and safeguard the natural surroundings. The construction of infrastructure to support these businesses may also have environmental consequences, such as habitat destruction or increased carbon emissions from transportation.\nIn conclusion, the relocation of industries and businesses from major cities to rural areas can mitigate congestion and bolster rural economies.

In comparison to the past, we now see more fathers choosing to stay at home and take on the role of homemaker, caring for their children while mothers pursue careers and provide for their families. In my view, this development brings numerous benefits for several reasons.\nTo begin with, the outdated traditions and cultural norms that once dictated rigid gender roles have gradually faded away. In the past, society often viewed women as weaker than men, leading to restrictions on their freedom, even within their own families. Women were primarily expected to shoulder household chores, such as cleaning, childcare, and other domestic responsibilities, while remaining financially dependent on their husbands.\nThis biased and unjust prejudice persisted for centuries until women began advocating for their rights, which constitutes the second reason behind this shift. The global movement for gender equality has gained momentum, with protests and demonstrations against the unfair treatment of women taking place worldwide. Thanks to their unwavering determination, women have achieved significant milestones and now enjoy the freedom to pursue their dreams. For instance, many women have successfully entered the realm of politics, holding high-ranking positions.\nLast but not least, the ability to fulfill familial responsibilities no longer hinges on one's gender but rather on their individual qualities and skills. A man can effectively care for his children if he possesses kindness and patience, just as a woman can excel in professions like medicine, aviation, or firefighting if she meets the necessary mental and physical requirements.\nIn my opinion, this societal development is entirely positive. It not only allows children to develop their skills, remain joyful, enthusiastic, and healthy, but also ensures they receive ample affection from both parents. Moreover, it fosters a broader understanding of the significance of women in society, leading to events like International Women's Day on March 8th, which celebrates their contributions.\nIn conclusion, the advantages of shifting traditional gender roles significantly outweigh any potential drawbacks.

Our characteristics can vary significantly due to various factors, including our living conditions, relationships, life events, and, most importantly, how our parents raise us. For example, a girl born into a family with a long-standing tradition of working with wood may develop a passion for carpentry and gradually acquire the necessary skills from her father.\nSecondly, there will always be exceptions in the world. If we constantly emphasize selecting the appropriate gender for specific occupations, we may inadvertently overlook many individuals with genuine talents.

In my view, I strongly agree that mobile phone games have a negative impact on society, leading to an increased number of accidents and a decline in social interaction.\nOne significant adverse effect of mobile games on society is the rise in accidents on the roads. With the ability to play games anywhere and anytime thanks to the handheld feature, people sometimes play games while driving or walking on the streets. For example, in 2016, the game Pokemon Go became extremely popular among teenagers. It required players to search for monsters in the real world. According to news reports, more than a thousand teenagers worldwide were injured in accidents involving cars or while crossing roads because they were always glued to their phones while driving or walking. Therefore, playing video games while operating vehicles should be prohibited due to the potential loss of life and property.\nFurthermore, addiction to video games can be attributed to a decline in relationships among family members. Instead of spending quality time with their loved ones, individuals addicted to gaming often spend hours playing online games with virtual friends. For instance, in the modern era, it is common to see people scrolling on their phones while having dinner, even when they are sitting at the same table with their family members, without exchanging a single word. As a result, mobile games steal away the quality time that families should spend talking and sharing daily experiences with each other.\nIn conclusion, due to the risks of accidents and the deterioration of social interactions, I firmly agree with the assertion that portable games are harmful to our society and its citizens.

While raising and caring for a child is usually considered the mother's specialty, and traditionally, the father would be out working to earn a living, these days, the opposite of the old norms is becoming more popular. This shift is mainly due to the development of society and improved living standards, making it easier to accept and enabling both parents to have the opportunity to fulfill either role.\nThe increase in women working and men staying home to take care of the house does not necessarily mean a decline in the competence of male workers, as some might assume. Many physically demanding jobs still prefer male workers, and a man staying at home doesn't mean he can't contribute to the family's income. Work-from-home opportunities are also on the rise and can provide a significant income. Furthermore, if parents are capable, they can divide childcare and work responsibilities by both having shorter work hours or different shifts, taking turns looking after their child. Both approaches can lead to more interaction between parents and their child, which is beneficial for the child's development, as both parents play a crucial role in their life.\nIn my personal opinion, having more stay-at-home dads and breadwinner moms does not have a negative impact on society. What's essential is how they fulfill their chosen roles and provide their children with a good life. If everything goes well, and the family is happy, there's nothing to complain about. I also believe that providing more opportunities and allowing women to be the main breadwinners of the family is a positive development. Many single mothers have shown that they can balance raising a child with work and still provide their children with a relatively good life, which is what we expect from a good mother. I think that if people who are equally capable as them could have someone to help share the responsibilities in their family, their lives would greatly improve.\nIn summary, the new trend of having fathers stay home and take care of the children while mothers work is evidence that society as a whole is changing for the better.

For instance, the renowned masterpiece \"Starry Night\" by Vincent Van Gogh beautifully captured the nocturnal scenery outside his hospital room, a mundane aspect of everyday life. Consequently, such gifted individuals not only convey their unique perspectives through their creative works but also inadvertently exhibit their boundless creativity and aesthetic sense.\nOn the other hand, I firmly believe that every individual can engage in art creation as a means of expressing their emotions.

However, this excitement may fade over time as they find themselves in unfamiliar positions contrary to their natural instincts. This can lead to stress and potentially affect the family bond.\nA second point to consider is that women tend to possess a natural nurturing capability that men may not have to the same extent. Mothers often excel at caring for children due to these innate qualities. While it is essential for a child to receive love and care from both parents, the unique nurturing abilities of a mother can play a significant role in a child's development. Therefore, reversing gender roles can have a negative impact not only on the mother but also on her child.\nLastly, it's worth noting that traditional gender roles have played a significant role in the development of human civilization. The idea of men providing for the family's economic needs while women nurture the children has been a prevalent family structure throughout much of human history. Despite ongoing discussions about gender equality, these traditional roles have provided a stable foundation for society.\nIn conclusion, while the concept of reversed gender roles may gain popularity and create some positivity, it is unlikely to become the most common family structure due to its potential long-term inefficiencies and its departure from the natural order of things. Traditional gender roles, with men as breadwinners and women as caregivers, have been deeply ingrained in human history and are likely to remain a prevalent family structure.\n"

      "paragraph": "Since the introduction of gadgets like smartphones and tablets, primarily used for entertainment, there has been an ongoing debate about their impact on individuals and society as a whole. I am of the opinion that handheld devices can have adverse effects on people, potentially leading to health problems and decreased work productivity due to smartphone addiction.\nTo begin with, the rise in average screen time, which refers to the average amount of time people spend in front of screens, has contributed to a widespread increase in eye-related issues. This conclusion is drawn from research conducted by the NHS, which indicates that the percentage of individuals experiencing vision problems in 2015 surged by 60% compared to 2005. Moreover, this study established a direct link between people's average screen time and the likelihood of developing vision problems. Therefore, it is evident that these devices can be considered detrimental to one's health.\nAdditionally, the accessibility of entertainment on smartphones and other portable gadgets has made it easier for people to use them excessively compared to traditional sources of entertainment like television. Consequently, some individuals have developed addictive behaviors, leading to a decrease in work efficiency as employees become easily distracted. A recent study conducted by the University of East Anglia in 2018 revealed that workers could waste up to two hours daily engaging with messaging apps and social networks on their portable devices. This further supports the argument that portable devices can have a negative impact on productivity.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that handheld devices have a detrimental effect on individuals as they contribute to health problems and hinder people's work performance due to the distractions posed by phones and other portable gadgets.\n"

      "question": "What are the factors that contribute to happiness?",
      "paragraph": "Happiness is a concept that has perplexed humans for centuries, making it challenging to provide a precise definition. Some individuals equate happiness with great wealth, while others assert that good health is the key to happiness. Nevertheless, what does happiness truly entail, and what factors contribute to it?\nThe definition of happiness varies from person to person, yet there is a unanimous agreement that it is an intangible essence that transcends sensory limitations. Happiness, in my view, resides in life's simplest pleasures. For instance, a destitute individual clad in tattered garments yearns for a modest home and three square meals a day, which they deem \"happiness.\" Similarly, a diligent student aspires to excel in examinations, experiencing a profound sense of elation. For an employee or laborer, earning enough to provide for their family's well-being is a source of immense joy. Conversely, older individuals often consider good health an unattainable luxury, so maintaining their physical well-being brings them unparalleled delight.\nThe factors influencing our emotions, particularly happiness, are a subject of curiosity. The answer is relatively straightforward: our family exerts the most significant influence on our thoughts and developmental journey. Growing up in a conservative household with limited openness constrains our opportunities for social interaction and learning, leading to a dearth of experiences with friends. This, in turn, creates a rift between us and our parents, ultimately eroding our happiness. Conversely, empathetic and permissive parents nurture optimistic, enthusiastic children who feel heard and receive guidance when necessary. Furthermore, the external environment, namely the society in which we reside, profoundly shapes our development. In a community characterized by sharing, care, and frequent smiles, the prevailing atmosphere fosters happiness.\nOur individual personality also plays a pivotal role in shaping our emotions. In similar situations, a positive-minded individual feels appreciation, energy, and boundless happiness for the journey ahead, while a pessimistic counterpart experiences sadness, disappointment, and discouragement, often refraining from giving it another try.\nIn conclusion, happiness can be attained with simplicity. It is not to be sought in opulence but rather in the familiar places where we encounter our most cherished moments.\n"

      "paragraph": "It is undeniable that various animal species are facing the risk of extinction due to human activities both on land and in the sea. There are several compelling reasons behind this issue, along with potential solutions.\nOn land, the destruction of wildlife habitats is a significant concern. Enormous areas of rainforest have been mercilessly cut down, leaving many animals without a place to call home. For some species, adapting to a new environment proves to be a daunting challenge. Consequently, these creatures find themselves at a higher risk of extinction.\nIn aquatic ecosystems, the impact of human activities is twofold. Firstly, some businesses and factories have installed inadequate treatment systems for their industrial or domestic waste, often directly releasing it into ponds, lakes, or ditches. This contamination, along with the tourism industry in coastal areas, results in harmful waste being discharged into the ocean, posing a grave threat to marine life. Secondly, overfishing disrupts the delicate balance of marine food chains, causing a significant decline in fish populations. Furthermore, oil spills from extraction processes have tragically claimed the lives of thousands of marine species.\nTo address these pressing issues, it is imperative for governments to take action. They should mandate that businesses and factories install proper waste treatment systems to minimize environmental harm. Additionally, providing financial support to organizations dedicated to the preservation of endangered species is crucial. Lastly, stricter penalties should be enforced, and public awareness campaigns should be promoted to educate individuals about their environmental responsibilities.\nIn conclusion, the perilous situation of wildlife extinction demands immediate attention and action. By implementing these solutions, we can hope to mitigate the adverse effects of human activities on our planet's precious ecosystems and safeguard the future of our diverse animal species.\n"

      "paragraph": "Some individuals argue that operating a family-owned business can enhance profitability, while others contend that it may lead to conflicts among family members and result in negative consequences. In my view, despite the numerous benefits associated with family-run enterprises, there are also certain drawbacks to consider. This essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of embarking on a family business venture.\nFirst and foremost, it is important to note that the most apparent advantage of a family-run business is the exceptionally high level of commitment and loyalty exhibited by its members. This can pave the way for further opportunities and eventual long-term success. For instance, when family members share a sense of trust and work collectively towards a common goal, it can contribute to the sustained stability of the business. Additionally, another notable benefit of family-owned businesses is the strengthening of financial stability due to reduced expenses. To illustrate, expenses associated with training and hiring qualified employees can be significantly reduced when all members share the same background and a common vision for their career.\nOn the other hand, there are certain drawbacks and challenges that can impede the growth of a family business, potentially offsetting its advantages. Firstly, excessive flexibility in work schedules, stemming from emotional connections, can lead to disruptive outcomes. For example, delegating responsibilities to colleagues during work hours due to a lack of structured leadership is a common occurrence in family-run enterprises. Moreover, sharing the same culture and background may increase the risk of groupthink within the company. This not only fails to promote diversity of thought but also limits the variety of ideas and proposals by narrowing the perspective.\nIn conclusion, family businesses, like any other profession, encompass both positive and negative aspects. Their profitability or detriment depends on various factors and circumstances. In my opinion, while the decision should be made after considering multiple facets, the advantages of a family-run enterprise generally outweigh its disadvantages.\n"

While some argue that these venues should have free admission, I hold the view that a fee should be imposed for entry.\nMany residents believe that the public should not be burdened with any fees when accessing museums or art galleries. Their primary argument is that these institutions are funded by the government through taxation paid by citizens. Therefore, when museums and art galleries charge entrance fees, it effectively amounts to double taxation. However, I contend that by charging visitors a nominal fee, these exhibitions can become financially self-sustaining. The revenue generated can then be allocated by the government for other vital facilities, such as roads, hospitals, and educational institutions.\nOn the contrary, there is another group of people who advocate not only for voluntary contributions but also mandatory entrance fees when visiting these sites. Firstly, they posit that charging visitors a modest fee serves to instill an appreciation for the historical and artistic value of the exhibits. While free admission may attract more citizens and tourists, it may lead to a neglect of the true worth of these artworks. Secondly, these fees can help cover various operational costs, including the salaries of those employed at these institutions.\nIn conclusion, I am of the opinion that public venues like museums and galleries should levy a reasonable entrance fee on visitors. This approach would facilitate their further development and ensure their sustainability.\n"

This perception is rooted in the idea that the wisdom children acquire from their families suffices for their future endeavors.\nIt is undeniable that parents and families play a significant role in shaping a child's life. Parents often possess practical knowledge owing to their age and life experiences. However, this can also be a drawback as there may be a generation gap between parents and their children, which can hinder effective communication. Nonetheless, nurturing good character is arguably more crucial than a formal education, and parents have a direct influence on a child's character development.\nOn the other hand, schools also hold a vital place in one's path to a successful life. In contemporary society, many international companies require candidates to hold a university degree. Consequently, whether an individual graduates from a prestigious institution can significantly impact their career prospects.

It is clear that individuals of all age groups increasingly rely on high-tech devices during their free moments. While this practice offers certain advantages, the associated disadvantages cannot be underestimated.\nOn the positive side, there are some minor benefits to using high-technology during leisure hours. One notable advantage is that many people turn to technology as a means to alleviate stress after dedicating significant efforts to their work. This can be attributed to the competitive nature of job markets, where individuals often face the pressure to excel and earn a higher income to sustain their living standards. Consequently, integrating technology into relaxation activities alongside work can help individuals strike a balance in their lives.\nHowever, the use of advanced technology carries substantial drawbacks that outweigh these positive aspects. One glaring issue is that technology's entertainment offerings can lead to reduced concentration on studies or work, especially in the case of games that demand strategic planning. This phenomenon is particularly evident among young individuals who are drawn to smartphone or laptop games, sometimes spending excessive amounts of time playing them. Certain games, like League of Legends, require players to commit a minimum of around 40 minutes per match, and leaving a game prematurely results in penalties. Consequently, some individuals spend up to an hour or more solely focused on gaming, with some even pursuing in-game achievements. This diversion hampers their productivity in academic pursuits or professional endeavors.\nIn conclusion, despite the potential benefits of using advanced technology for relaxation during leisure time, these advantages pale in comparison to the associated drawbacks. The allure of technology-driven entertainment can lead to a detrimental lack of focus on essential aspects of life, such as education and work. Therefore, while technology has its merits, individuals should exercise caution and moderation in its use to ensure a well-balanced and productive life.\n"

While I concur that financial compensation should be a crucial factor when selecting a job, I firmly believe that other significant factors play an equally important role in enhancing job satisfaction.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that money plays an essential role in meeting basic human needs. For most job seekers, a high-paying job is a top priority as it enables them to cover expenses such as housing, transportation, and supporting their families. If individuals opt for careers solely based on non-financial considerations, there is a limited likelihood that they can adequately support themselves and maintain enthusiasm for their work. For instance, a majority of artists choose to pursue drawing and painting as a means of earning a living, which often leads to only modest improvements in their overall quality of life.\nOn the other hand, I maintain the perspective that other factors are equally vital. Firstly, a considerable number of employees place a high value on personal relationships and the working environment over the offered salary. Within the workplace, having supportive and friendly colleagues, along with empathetic managers, can significantly contribute to professional fulfillment and overall satisfaction. Secondly, personal achievements, such as reaching high positions and honing specialized skills, may take precedence for some individuals. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the workforce selects their occupation based on factors other than financial remuneration, driven by their passion for making meaningful contributions to society as a whole.\nIn conclusion, I agree that salary is a key consideration in choosing a job; however, I firmly believe that other elements are equally vital in enhancing people's overall happiness and job satisfaction.\n"

Some fervently advocate that they should allow people to earn as much as companies are willing to pay. Others, including myself, believe that employee remuneration should be capped at a certain level.\nAdmittedly, there are various reasons why it might be considered beneficial to allow people to be paid extremely high salaries. If companies offer excellent pay packages, they can attract the most talented people in their fields to work for them. For example, technology companies like Google are able to employ the best programmers because of the huge sums that they are willing to pay. Furthermore, these well-paid employees are likely to be highly motivated to work hard and, therefore, drive their businesses successfully. In theory, this should result in a thriving economy and increased tax revenues, which means paying high salaries benefits everyone.\nNotwithstanding the aforementioned arguments, I side with proponents of introducing a limit on earnings. By taking this action, the gap in pay between bosses and employees can be reduced. Currently, the difference between normal and top high salaries is huge, and this can demotivate workers who feel the situation is unfair. With lower executive salaries, it might become feasible to introduce higher minimum wages, and everybody would be better off. One possible consequence of greater equality could be a reduction in poverty and criminal rates because the general population would enjoy an improved standard of living.\nTo sum up, while there are theoretical justifications for paying high salaries to employees, I am against this policy due to its detrimental repercussions. I personally prefer that governments set a limit on the wages of the highest earners in society.\n"

This essay aims to explore the potential reasons behind this inclination and assess whether it represents a positive or negative development.\nIt is evident that several factors drive the contemporary need for rapid services and information. Firstly, the fast-paced nature of modern society stands out as a primary catalyst for this trend. For instance, many employees frequently engage in overtime work or multitasking to boost their income. Simultaneously, students enroll in numerous supplementary classes to enhance their academic performance. Consequently, they rely on expedited everyday services such as meals and administrative procedures to save both time and money. Secondly, technological advancements play a pivotal role in meeting the demand for immediate information and services. For instance, 24-hour news channels constantly update viewers with the latest global developments, while the ubiquity of the internet enables people to shop online instead of visiting physical stores. As a result, individuals are gradually developing a penchant for swift access to services and information, aided by enhancements in their surroundings.\nFrom my perspective, this trend bears both positive and negative implications for society. On the positive side, a busy lifestyle can lead to heightened daily productivity, enabling individuals to accomplish more tasks efficiently. Undoubtedly, this can result in increased productivity and income for each person. From a broader perspective, the improved performance of individuals in society can promote overall economic development. However, on the flip side, this habit fosters a hectic lifestyle in which people are perpetually rushing to complete tasks in a short timeframe. A typical example of this is the rushed meals of most office workers, who often sacrifice the pleasure of their food and the moments they could savor to arrive at work on time. In the long run, this heightened pace of life exerts additional pressure on individuals and poses risks to their psychological well-being.\nIn conclusion, the fast-paced nature of life, coupled with technological advancements, underlies the preference for swift task completion.

From my perspective, this is undeniably a positive development, despite some minor drawbacks.\nAdmittedly, social interactions can be limited due to reduced face-to-face contact with others. People have embraced an online lifestyle, allowing them to carry out their work and education from considerable distances. This has led to a decline in in-person communication, particularly with loved ones who reside outside one's immediate vicinity. However, it is important to recognize how technology has evolved to meet the growing need for communication.

In my opinion, I partly agree with this perspective for several reasons.\nThe role of schools in society is unique, as they provide knowledge and assess students' learning abilities through examinations. The analysis and exploration of academic theories consider a student's academic success, which serves as the foundation for gaining admission to higher education institutions. Furthermore, school academic programs enable students to gain a deeper understanding of various subjects and identify their strengths, helping them choose a suitable career path. For instance, in China, high schools are divided into two departments, one for social science subjects and the other for natural science subjects. Because students receive a wide range of knowledge, they can study effectively and achieve good results, laying the groundwork for higher education at top-tier universities. Therefore, without being taught academic theory in schools and passing examinations, students may struggle to select the right career path.\nHowever, other skills also play an equally crucial role alongside academics.

This essay will explore both perspectives before presenting the author's viewpoint.\nTo commence, proponents of constructing numerous sports centers contend that it can heighten residents' awareness of health improvement. Firstly, the presence of a sports center in a residential area offers increased opportunities for people to enhance their well-being. For example, gym owners often arrange experiential events to entice local residents to try their facilities. Following these trial sessions, individuals may opt to enroll for a membership, committing to future fitness routines. Moreover, sports centers typically employ coaches who devise customized dietary and training plans to facilitate health improvement and maintain physical fitness. If residents diligently follow these expert guidelines, they can anticipate noticeable health improvements in the near future.\nConversely, others maintain that the impact of constructing sports centers on public health is limited, suggesting alternative approaches.

One of the primary concerns is the potential loss of natural habitats. Vietnam serves as an illustrative example of this issue, as many corporations are likely to drill for oil and gas resources in remote and untouched areas. Consequently, numerous precious animals, such as deer and rhinos, are on the brink of extinction. Another important point to consider is that this trend could potentially displace indigenous people. Since many remote areas are home to these communities that have lived there for generations, oil and gas extraction may force them to relocate, significantly impacting their culture and way of life.\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential benefits of exploring oil and gas in remote and intact places, I am convinced that the disadvantages of this trend indeed outweigh its advantages.\n"

      "question": "Should fixed punishments be used for all crimes?",
      "paragraph": "The question of whether there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime is a complex one, with strong arguments on both sides.\nThose who advocate for fixed punishments argue that it is the fairest way to ensure that everyone who commits the same crime receives the same punishment, regardless of their individual circumstances. They also contend that fixed punishments deter crime because potential criminals will be less likely to commit a crime if they know that they will receive a predetermined punishment.\nOn the other hand, those who believe that the circumstances of an individual crime should always be taken into account argue that fixed punishments are not always fair. They point out that two people who commit the same crime may have very different motivations and circumstances, and that these factors should be considered when deciding on a punishment. They also argue that fixed punishments can lead to injustice, as a person who commits a crime under extenuating circumstances may receive the same punishment as someone who commits the same crime with no justification.\nThere is no easy answer to the question of whether there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Both sides have valid points, and the best approach may vary depending on the specific crime and the circumstances of the individual case.\nIn my opinion, the best approach is to have a system of fixed punishments that is flexible enough to take into account the circumstances of an individual crime. For example, a crime like murder could have a fixed punishment of life imprisonment, but the judge could have the discretion to reduce the sentence if there are extenuating circumstances, such as if the murder was committed in self-defense.\nThis approach would ensure that everyone who commits a crime receives a fair punishment, while also allowing for flexibility in cases where the circumstances warrant it.\n"

      "question": "Should we use fixed punishments or individualized sentencing in the criminal justice system?",
      "paragraph": "The discussion regarding fixed punishments versus context-based sentencing within the criminal justice system is a multifaceted and long-standing issue. Advocates of fixed punishments propose the establishment of set penalties for each type of crime, regardless of the specific circumstances or reasons behind the offense. Conversely, supporters of individualized sentencing argue that the circumstances of the crime and the offender's motivation should play a crucial role in determining the suitable punishment.\nThose in favor of fixed punishments assert that they bring clarity, consistency, and fairness to the legal system. A predetermined penalty system can discourage potential wrongdoers and ensure that individuals who commit the same crime receive equal treatment under the law. This approach reduces the likelihood of bias or discrimination in sentencing, promoting a more just and equitable society.\nOn the other hand, proponents of context-based sentencing stress the importance of considering the unique circumstances and motivations behind each crime. They argue that a one-size-fits-all approach fails to take into account factors such as an individual's background, mental state, or intent. Context-based sentencing empowers judges to assess mitigating or aggravating circumstances, tailoring the punishment to the specific case. This approach may result in more rehabilitative measures for offenders with underlying issues, potentially reducing the rate of reoffending.\nIn conclusion, the debate between fixed punishments and context-based sentencing highlights the inherent tension between consistency and individualization in the criminal justice system. Striking the right balance between these two perspectives is vital for a fair and effective legal system. Achieving this equilibrium may involve a hybrid approach that combines fixed penalties for certain crimes with some discretion for judges to consider the nuances of individual cases. Ultimately, the objective should be to ensure that justice is served while accounting for the complexities of human behavior and the circumstances surrounding criminal acts.\n"

Some argue that the government should shoulder the responsibility for this concern. However, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint.\nIt is easy to comprehend why many people believe that tackling childhood obesity should fall within the government's purview, considering their authority and resources to enact laws and policies. Lawmakers can implement measures like imposing higher taxes or raising prices on products that are detrimental to youngsters' well-being, such as sugary beverages and snacks. For instance, the Vietnamese government recently issued a directive mandating that local schools serve nutritious meals. This directive was put in place to ensure that school lunches align with the latest dietary recommendations, emphasizing the availability of fruits and vegetables.

In my opinion, despite the many advantages of family-run businesses, there are also some drawbacks to consider. This essay will discuss the pros and cons of starting a family business.\nFirst and foremost, it should be noted that the most apparent advantage of a family-run business is the high level of commitment and loyalty among its members, which can open up further opportunities for development and ultimately lead to continued success. For example, when family members share a common goal and have a sense of trust in each other, it can contribute to the long-term stability of that particular business. Additionally, another clear benefit of a family-owned enterprise is the strengthening of financial capability due to reduced costs and expenditures. For instance, the extra expenses associated with training qualified employees can be minimized when all members have the same background and a common vision for their career.\nOn the other hand, some drawbacks and challenges can impede the growth of a family business, potentially affecting its advantages. Firstly, excessive flexibility in the work schedule due to emotional ties can result in disruptive outcomes. For instance, delegating responsibilities to other colleagues during work hours due to a lack of structured leadership is quite common in family-run businesses. Furthermore, having the same culture and background within the family can increase the risk of groupthink within the company. This not only hinders creativity but also limits the diversity of ideas and proposals due to a narrowed perspective.\nIn conclusion, like any other type of profession, family businesses have both positive and negative aspects. Depending on the circumstances, they can be profitable or detrimental. In my perspective, while the decision should be made by considering various factors, the advantages of a family-run business outweigh its disadvantages in most cases.\n"

In light of this, many countries are striving to host such events, with some arguing that host countries would reap several benefits from global-scale sports competitions. Meanwhile, others worry about the detrimental impacts associated with organizing these events. This essay aims to examine both views more closely before concluding that hosting these competitions is detrimental to the country due to its financial pressures.\nGranted, the benefits that organizing world-scale sports events confers on a country are evident. One of these is that it would greatly boost national tourism through a massive influx of foreigners coming to watch sports matches and enjoy the festive atmosphere of the events. Additionally, more jobs in this sector would be generated for the locals, thus curbing the unemployment rate. However, these two advantages are, to a large extent, short-term and unsustainable ones, since when the event ends, there is no promise of a thriving tourism industry and stable jobs for the community.\nFurthermore, I am convinced that hosting major sports competitions would actually do the nation itself a huge disservice. To be specific, given the exorbitant expenses in the form of upgrading the transport system and constructing sophisticated sports facilities, among other things, the country, especially developing ones whose budgets are often limited, could be burdened with high debts. This would, as a result, place a significant financial burden on taxpayers and might even, in the worst-case scenario, be the cause of political disagreement, possibly leading to social unrest. Compared to the potential benefits of organizing cross-border sports matches, its drawbacks are far more pronounced.\nTo conclude, even though there are justifications for hosting world-scale sports events being beneficial to the host country, I would argue that these advantages mostly last for a short period of time.

A home provides us with a place to live, and living in a well-equipped environment can significantly contribute to our physical and mental well-being. Furthermore, a home holds a special significance for everyone. It serves as a comfortable and pleasant sanctuary where individuals can unwind after a taxing day of work or study. It is a place where people can truly be themselves. Consequently, renting or owning a home is a common aspiration, especially among young people. Having a home not only signifies the importance of this space in our lives but also reflects one's ability to plan for their future.\nOn the other hand, I completely disagree with the notion that the government should bear the responsibility of providing housing for all homeless individuals. Firstly, assisting everyone unable to afford housing would entail a substantial financial burden on the government. Constructing apartments and flats for such individuals would require a significant expenditure of public funds, which would not yield any returns. Additionally, these accommodations would necessitate periodic maintenance and renovation expenses, further straining government resources. If the government consistently provides free housing to those in need, it may encourage dependency on government support, hindering the rapid development of the economy.\nSecondly, securing housing is an individual's duty. People can explore various employment opportunities to afford the cost of renting a home. Instead of relying on government assistance, individuals can actively seek suitable employment that matches their skills and work diligently to cover their living expenses. For example, despite the high cost of apartments in Sweden, Swedish citizens make determined efforts to find work that allows them to meet their housing expenses.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that housing is a critical component of human life.

Opinions vary regarding whether allowing students to offer feedback and criticism to their teachers would undermine discipline and respect in the classroom or if it should be encouraged. While there are valid arguments supporting the former view, I am inclined to support the latter.\nThose who argue that allowing comments and criticism could erode respect and discipline in the classroom have a valid point. They contend that most students may lack the maturity needed to provide objective evaluations of their teachers, potentially leading to emotionally charged assessments that lack fairness. In such a scenario, teachers who normally reprimand and discipline unruly students for egregious mistakes might face retaliation through unfounded criticism. Consequently, the sense of solidarity between teachers and students could weaken, ultimately resulting in a loss of meaningful interaction. This example illustrates why some people believe that comments or criticism could directly impact teachers' methods and undermine respect and solidarity among student groups.\nNevertheless, I maintain the belief that enabling students to provide feedback to their educators can offer significant advantages. One compelling reason is that when students are allowed to provide feedback, educators can gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses, helping them better understand their students' areas of struggle and enabling them to find solutions. For instance, in cases where students lack a foundational understanding of a subject and struggle to keep up with the pace of instruction, they can offer feedback, which amounts to constructive criticism. This, in turn, allows teachers to adjust their teaching methods, slowing down when necessary. Consequently, this can assist teachers in enhancing their pedagogical skills, earning the respect and engagement of their students.\nIn conclusion, despite recognizing the concerns that some may raise about the potential negative effects of allowing comments or criticism on the overall dynamics between teachers and students, I still firmly believe that encouraging feedback can yield numerous benefits for teachers and learners alike.\n"

Some individuals are committed to sustaining their professional growth, and staying employed represents the most effective means to achieve this objective. Take, for example, IT developers who must continuously adapt to the latest programming languages to remain competitive in their industry. Moreover, remaining in the workforce contributes positively to individuals' mental well-being.

They may assert that university courses like medicine, engineering, and information technology are much more beneficial than art degrees. From a personal perspective, it can be argued that these courses provide more job opportunities, better career prospects, higher salaries, and thus, an improved quality of life for students who pursue them. On a societal level, by encouraging people to specialize in particular subjects, governments can ensure that knowledge and skill gaps in the economy are adequately covered. Moreover, a focus on technology in higher education could lead to new inventions and economic growth.\nHowever, notwithstanding the aforementioned arguments, I side with proponents of giving students the freedom to choose their preferred areas of study. The primary reason is that if students are passionate about what they are learning, they are more likely to excel in their chosen field. Besides, it is challenging to predict which areas of knowledge will be most valuable in the future. It is possible that employers may come to value creative thinking skills above practical or technological skills. If this were the case, perhaps we would need more students studying art and history.\nIn conclusion, while there are theoretical justifications for only allowing students to study subjects that are useful, I am against this policy due to its detrimental repercussions.

Consequently, numerous precious animal species, such as deer and rhinos, are on the brink of extinction. Another noteworthy point to discuss is that this trend could potentially displace indigenous people. As many remote areas are the ancestral homes of these people who have lived there for generations, oil and gas extraction can compel them to relocate, which may profoundly affect their culture and way of life.\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential benefits of exploring oil and gas in remote and untouched places, I am convinced that the disadvantages indeed outweigh the advantages.\n"

      "question": "Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of accepting unfavorable circumstances, such as a dissatisfying job or financial constraints. Do you agree or disagree that it is better to strive for improvement?",
      "paragraph": "It is undeniable that people often encounter challenging situations in their lives. While some individuals advocate for accepting unfavorable circumstances, such as a dissatisfying job or financial constraints, others contend that it is a wiser decision to make an effort to improve these situations.\nOn one hand, there is merit in the idea that individuals should sometimes endure difficult situations. Firstly, enduring adversity can help individuals avoid the risks associated with pursuing a better situation or greater power. Strong desires for improved conditions can drive individuals to take extreme measures. For instance, someone trapped in a stressful and low-paying job might accept a long commute to a better-paying job in a more pleasant work environment. However, this decision can lead to accidents and physical injuries during the commute. Such risks are inherent when people strive to escape their current unsatisfactory circumstances. Secondly, contentment with unfavorable conditions can reduce the likelihood of individuals resorting to criminal activities. When people lack money, they struggle to meet their daily needs and provide for their families, including necessities like food, transportation, and utility bills. Consequently, some may turn to criminal activities, such as theft or even murder, to acquire money illegally.\nOn the other hand, I believe that it is essential to endeavor to improve one's adverse circumstances. Overcoming adversity can open up better opportunities in terms of employment, relationships, and health, leading to an improved quality of life. Consequently, individuals can meet their needs, enhance their living standards, and provide support to their families. Moreover, those who successfully navigate challenging situations develop valuable skills that enable them to tackle future obstacles with confidence. They are less afraid of failure because they know that if they have overcome severe circumstances in the past, they can handle whatever challenges come their way in the future.\nIn conclusion, while both perspectives have their merits, I am inclined to believe that it is better to strive for improvement rather than simply accepting a harsh situation.\n"

      "paragraph": "The question of whether ordinary citizens should be allowed to keep a gun in their homes has sparked intense debate. Some strongly support this idea, while others, including myself, believe that permitting private gun ownership would have significant negative consequences for society and should therefore be prohibited.\nSupporters of the right to own firearms argue that everyone has the right to protect themselves and that it is justifiable to possess a gun for self-defense against potential threats. They suggest that banning personal firearms could lead to resentment among citizens, possibly escalating into widespread social discontent. The United States is a prime example, where attempts to regulate private gun ownership have triggered heated controversy among the public. In some states, the situation has escalated to the point where thousands participate in protests to challenge government authorities.\nHowever, I align with those who oppose the idea of allowing people to own guns at home. My primary reason for this stance is that ensuring public safety does not require the freedom to own firearms. Strengthening the rule of law and increasing surveillance through the widespread use of CCTV systems are viable alternatives that can enhance public security. Vietnam serves as an excellent example of this approach. Despite its ban on private gun ownership, Vietnam consistently ranks as one of the safest countries in the world, demonstrating the effectiveness of alternative security measures.\nAnother reason for my position relates to the potentially devastating consequences of private gun ownership. The United States, for instance, has experienced an alarmingly high rate of gun-related violence. Mass shootings, made easier by easy access to firearms, have tragically claimed thousands of lives over the years. The cost of this so-called \"self-defense privilege\" appears unacceptably high.\nIn conclusion, while there are theoretical arguments in favor of allowing individuals to own guns at home, I oppose this policy due to its harmful consequences. Prioritizing alternative means of ensuring public security, such as strengthening legal frameworks and implementing surveillance systems, offers a more practical path to safeguarding public safety.\n"

      "paragraph": "In today's modern era, the excessive use of consumer products poses a threat to our natural environment. Two major factors contributing to this issue are the rapid population growth and excessive consumption. I will now discuss some potential solutions to address this problem.\nThe damage to the environment is primarily driven by the surge in population and mass production. To begin with, the growing global population in recent years has led to an increased demand for consumer goods such as infrastructure, food, and services. For instance, the expanding population requires more housing, resulting in the felling of trees for wood, which is used in construction. This, in turn, leads to the clearing of land for building purposes. Consequently, the habitats of various animal and plant species are being displaced by human activities, pushing them towards extinction and causing numerous environmental issues such as floods and droughts.\nMoreover, the proliferation of unhealthy fast food items like hamburgers, pizza, and french fries encourages people to spend money on these items, leading to the mass production of high-calorie foods. As a result, individuals are more likely to gain weight easily and suffer from various health problems related to the cardiovascular system.\nThese factors have significant adverse effects on our natural environment. To address this problem, two crucial solutions can be implemented. Firstly, governments should focus on promoting comprehensive sex education to raise awareness among teenagers and reduce teenage pregnancies. For example, in Vietnam, professionals are invited to secondary or high schools to organize informative programs, exposing students to sex education. Additionally, local councils can encourage residents to adopt healthier lifestyles by engaging in regular physical activity and consuming natural products, thereby reducing the demand for harmful consumer goods. This approach can not only extend their lifespan but also promote a healthier way of living. Therefore, governments should take these steps to safeguard our natural environment.\nIn conclusion, the widespread use of consumer goods has negative consequences for the natural environment. However, governments and local councils have already devised strategies to tackle these issues and pave the way for a brighter future for our society.\n"

From my standpoint, I respectfully disagree with this assertion.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that spoken communication can offer certain notable advantages. One of the most evident benefits is its accessibility to a wide range of individuals. Without a doubt, when information is conveyed through speech, especially in urgent situations like a fire emergency, people can readily comprehend the message and take timely action to avert a potential catastrophe by preparing promptly. Consequently, oral language can be the optimal choice for conveying crucial messages within a short span of time.\nHowever, despite the aforementioned advantage, there is no denying that written communication has its indisputable merits. One significant benefit is its ability to preserve information accurately over an extended period. Undoubtedly, vital historical events have traditionally been documented in writing, allowing them to be carefully preserved for generations. This, in turn, provides future generations with access to precise historical information, enabling them to gain deeper insights into the past. As a result, people seldom encounter difficulties when searching for ancient documents for research purposes, thus facilitating a comprehensive understanding of historical details.\nIn conclusion, while spoken communication can offer immediate benefits by swiftly disseminating information during urgent situations, I firmly support the notion that written communication is undeniably advantageous. This is primarily because of its capacity to exert a lasting impact on society, thanks to its ability to preserve precise information for research purposes.\n"

Some argue that it is the government's duty to address this problem, but I strongly disagree with this perspective.\nIt is understandable why many individuals assert that the government should take the lead in combating child obesity, given their authority and resources to establish laws and policies. Policymakers can implement measures like imposing higher taxes or raising prices on products that are detrimental to youngsters' health, such as sugary drinks and unhealthy foods. For instance, the Vietnamese government recently issued a directive mandating local schools to provide nutritious meals. This directive aims to ensure that school meals adhere to the latest dietary guidelines, promoting the availability of fruits and vegetables. This not only enhances the nutritional quality of meals but also supports children's well-being.\nOn the contrary, I believe that families bear the ultimate responsibility for the health of their children. While it is undeniable that the food industry exerts a significant influence on children's eating habits, placing the entire burden on the government sidelines the crucial role of parental guidance and individual choices. For instance, a study published in the International Journal of Obesity discovered that children's food choices are strongly shaped by their parents' eating behaviors.

In my view, animals ought not to be confined within such enclosures, and their habitats should not be disrupted.\nMany individuals believe that wildlife sanctuaries serve several purposes. Zoos can aid a wide array of animals by shielding them from poachers and other hazards that imperil their habitats and survival. As an illustration, some zoos implement breeding programs to bolster the populations of rare species. Furthermore, these facilities enable people to closely observe and learn about animals, thereby heightening public awareness.\nNevertheless, despite the validity of some of these points, I remain convinced that wildlife enclosures are superfluous. For instance, these parks can only accommodate a limited number of species, offering them restricted sustenance, care, and minimal environmental stimulation. Consequently, animals spend their entire lives confined within cages, their freedom curtailed. Moreover, for entertainment purposes, live animals like chickens and pigs are placed into cages with starving lions and tigers, an act that is ethically objectionable. Most animals, such as lions, tigers, and monkeys, appear livelier and healthier in their natural forest habitats in comparison to their existence within the confines of a zoo.\nIn conclusion, while animal sanctuaries may offer certain advantages, they are inherently cruel environments that harm animals. It is my belief that animals should revel in their natural habitats rather than being held in captivity.\"\n"

While some argue that the government should take the primary responsibility for addressing this issue, I contend that parents also have a crucial role in safeguarding their children's health.\nOn one hand, children are more influenced by their family's way of life than by government regulations. Parents serve as the initial educators for their offspring and are responsible for shaping their dietary habits. If a family maintains a healthy lifestyle, which includes providing nutritious meals and engaging in regular exercise, children are likely to follow suit. Conversely, if parents lead unhealthy lives, their children may struggle to differentiate between junk food and nutritionally sound options. Moreover, government regulations are only effective when parents cooperate and encourage their children to adhere to them. Parents not only play an indispensable role in shaping youngsters' eating habits but also guide them in adhering to national dietary standards. Children's health and awareness are contingent on their parents' lifestyle choices and their approach to educating them.\nOn the other hand, the government should take measures to limit the availability of fast food and unhealthy options in the national market, while also increasing public awareness of healthy eating habits. Implementing tax reforms that impose higher taxes on fast food and lower taxes on vegetables and fruits can incentivize parents to prioritize healthier options for their children. When these nutritious foods are more affordable and offer clear health benefits, they are more likely to become the primary choices for family meals. Few individuals would opt for unhealthy food, which not only carries a higher price tag but also poses significant risks to health. Furthermore, educational initiatives about nutrition and health should be integrated into school curricula and national television programs. While children learn about nutrition and health at school, the government should also organize workshops for parents to acquire knowledge and develop skills in educating their children about the adverse effects of unhealthy eating.\nIn conclusion, both the government and parents play pivotal roles in promoting children's health. Addressing childhood obesity is not solely the government's responsibility but is also influenced by the lifestyle choices of parents.

For instance, excessive studying may leave them with less time for physical exercise, leading to fatigue and exhaustion, which can have adverse effects on both their physical and mental well-being.\nFurthermore, the benefits of focusing solely on one subject are undeniable. University students can delve deeply into their chosen field of study, gaining a thorough understanding and mastery of both knowledge and skills. This specialization can prepare them exceptionally well for their future careers. For instance, a medical student may argue that dedicating sufficient time to mastering subjects like human anatomy, physiology, and medical procedures is essential for becoming a competent doctor. However, it's worth noting that a narrow focus on a single subject may result in a lack of knowledge in other areas, such as social information and life skills. To illustrate, a student who exclusively studies English within their major may have limited knowledge of other crucial aspects, such as technology and economics. This could make it challenging for them to perform simple household repairs or manage their finances effectively.\nIn conclusion, despite the merits of both dedicating all of one's attention to obtaining a qualification and exploring other subjects, I believe that a balanced approach, combining specialization with a multidisciplinary approach, offers significant advantages.\n"

However, others argue that there are more efficient methods available. This essay will discuss both views and then present my own opinion.\nOn the one hand, it is argued that car-free days are a meaningful way to reduce air pollution. Firstly, by banning cars in certain areas, the number of vehicles on the road is significantly reduced. This results in fewer emissions and harmful smoke being released into the atmosphere. For instance, in Aalborg, an industrial city in Denmark, May 1st is observed as a car-free day, during which vehicles are prohibited on the roads. As a result, the air quality in this city has improved significantly. Secondly, car-free days can promote the use of public transport. When more people choose public transport over private vehicles, it contributes to long-term air pollution reduction.\nOn the other hand, some believe that air pollution could be reduced more effectively through other methods. Firstly, a better solution is to replace old vehicles with electric vehicles that run on electricity and are environmentally friendly. This would significantly reduce emissions and air pollution levels. Therefore, governments could provide more incentives for people to use electric vehicles and limit the use of private transportation. Additionally, planting a large number of trees is another effective approach. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the air, making the atmosphere fresher and cleaner.\nIn conclusion, while car-free days can be a useful strategy, relying solely on them may not have a substantial impact on reducing air pollution. There are other strategies that could be more effective. In my opinion, governments need to take additional measures such as improving public transportation and increasing tree planting efforts to combat air pollution.\n"

Firstly, when parents readily fulfill every request of their child, it can lead to the child becoming spoiled. Additionally, if a child faces academic challenges and their parents do not provide appropriate guidance, they may struggle to improve their performance in school. Furthermore, without thoughtful supervision and proper upbringing, children may become disrespectful towards others due to their familiarity with the lenient environment created by their parents.

They are given freedom from a young age, which helps them develop valuable skills such as self-assurance and courage, essential for their future careers. These children tend to face life's challenges with less fear and may even thrive on them, as they are taught to tackle problems independently from a young age. Furthermore, they do not experience excessive pressure or anxiety because their parents do not impose high expectations on them. Without external pressure, they have the freedom to choose their focus and often excel compared to their peers. Moreover, these children tend to trust their parents and are more willing to share their joys and sorrows since there is no generation gap between them. Consequently, they are encouraged to pursue their interests in education, ultimately leading to a happier life.\nIn conclusion, the parenting style of being easy-going with children has both advantages and disadvantages. However, on balance, I firmly believe that children can greatly benefit if they are well-raised by lenient parents.\n"

      "paragraph": "After completing their school education, teenagers often face the dilemma of choosing between entering the workforce immediately or pursuing higher education. While there are advantages to starting a job right after school, I firmly believe that enrolling in college or university is the superior choice.\nOpting to commence employment immediately holds a certain appeal for various reasons. Many young individuals aspire to begin earning money at the earliest opportunity. This allows them to attain independence and afford a home or even start a family. Moreover, those who opt for work right after school may experience quicker career progression. They gain valuable practical experience and acquire skills relevant to their chosen profession. This practical knowledge can lead to promotions and a prosperous career.\nConversely, I contend that continuing one's education is more advantageous. Firstly, numerous professions demand academic qualifications. For instance, becoming a doctor, teacher, or lawyer necessitates obtaining the relevant degree. Consequently, university graduates have access to a broader range of job opportunities and tend to command higher salaries compared to those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the job market is growing increasingly competitive, often inundated with numerous applicants for a single position within a company. Young individuals lacking qualifications from a university or college find it challenging to compete effectively.\nIn light of the aforementioned reasons, it is my belief that students are more likely to achieve success in their careers if they extend their education beyond the school level.\n"

      "paragraph": "Many young individuals nowadays frequently change their jobs throughout their careers. In my view, this tendency can be attributed to the aspiration for improved prospects and career advancement. Nonetheless, there are still more drawbacks than advantages to this phenomenon.\nTo commence, there exist certain advantages to the idea of young people transitioning between jobs. Firstly, they aspire to secure higher salaries and advance in their careers. Achieving promotions is a common aspiration among many young adults, driven by the desire for greater knowledge and substantial income. Consequently, they are often willing to decline offers from even major companies if those offers do not align with their expectations. Secondly, young individuals can enhance their diverse skill set by engaging in various job roles. This is because some companies encourage creativity and innovation in their employees, while others prioritize patience and determination. Consequently, changing jobs enables young people to flourish by honing their skills and increasing their earnings.\nNonetheless, switching careers can result in various negative consequences. A significant concern is the instability it introduces to one's career trajectory. When an individual has a clear career path, they tend to stay committed to a job and consistently seek better opportunities within the same organization. Moreover, adapting to new roles and environments can be challenging and time-consuming. This can impede their ability to fully concentrate on their work. This is why many young individuals opt to stay in a single job to maintain stability and save time.\nIn conclusion, while young people may find improved conditions in new job opportunities, it is evident that the disadvantages still outweigh the benefits.\n"

While it is important for young individuals to maintain a connection with their families to a certain extent, I am of the opinion that they should also partake in a variety of activities that enhance their social relationships.\nOn one hand, there are several notable advantages to young people spending a significant amount of time with their families. Firstly, families provide an abundance of unconditional love that cannot be easily replicated by others. For instance, when someone falls ill unexpectedly, their parents will provide immediate medical care without any complaints. Secondly, families consistently support young individuals through the various stages of their daily lives, even when there may be occasional gaps in communication. Furthermore, parents not only offer valuable advice to their children but also provide encouragement during times of difficulty.\nOn the other hand, I believe that it is highly beneficial for young people to nurture a broader network of social relationships through engaging in outside activities. One compelling reason for this is that society plays a pivotal role in helping individuals achieve their goals. For example, after graduating from university, young people need a diverse network of social connections to explore new career opportunities within the business world. Additionally, young individuals are brimming with energy, and they should have the opportunity to enjoy various forms of entertainment and activities to unwind and alleviate the stress they encounter at work. Moreover, participating in social activities contributes positively to the well-being of young people, affording them moments of happiness and the chance to relish the joys of life.\nIn conclusion, while there are valid reasons why young people should maintain a connection with their families to some extent, I firmly believe that they should also engage in a variety of social activities to gain a more positive outlook on life.\n"

From my perspective, I firmly believe that the Internet is a valuable tool for human communication, and I have several reasons to support this viewpoint.\nFirst and foremost, the Internet offers numerous benefits. The convenience of social networking sites such as Facebook or Instagram facilitates users in maintaining connections with their family members and friends. For example, during the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, people around the world were confined to their homes, and the popularity of these social media platforms brought about significant changes in people's lives. Secondly, the Internet enables students to access a wide range of educational resources through electronic devices. For instance, students can visit online reading websites that regularly upload the latest versions of various books. Consequently, both students and ordinary individuals can gain more knowledge while saving time and energy.\nDespite the advantages of the Internet mentioned above, I believe that every invention has its drawbacks, and the Internet is no exception. Clearly, in recent times, a significant number of teenagers spend excessive amounts of time on social media platforms. Consequently, they are susceptible to various physical and mental health issues, such as myopia from prolonged phone screen use or obesity due to a lack of outdoor physical activities. However, I must acknowledge that, when considering all aspects, the benefits of the Internet outweigh its drawbacks. Therefore, Internet users should allocate their time wisely to harness the full potential of the Internet.\nIn conclusion, I assert that humans can derive numerous advantages from the Internet, despite the side effects of excessive social media use.

      "paragraph": "There is a belief that children's development can be significantly influenced by external factors, apart from the family. Personally, I firmly believe that the role of outside influences on a child's upbringing does not always outweigh the influence of the family.\nOn the one hand, there are valid reasons why external influences can substantially contribute to a child's development. To begin with, it is the acquisition of soft skills that children can readily gain through external influences, which may be challenging to achieve within the confines of their home environment. Consider schools, for instance; they not only impart a wide range of knowledge across various subjects but also organize outdoor activities like camping or tree planting. These activities foster teamwork and help students understand the benefits of cooperation with their peers. Furthermore, a child's friends during their formative years can partially influence their thinking, speech, and behavior. Exposure to poorly-behaved peers can lead children to act aggressively, communicate rudely, and exhibit behaviors that may disturb others.\nOn the other hand, the fundamental role of the family in a child's upbringing is undeniable. Firstly, households serve as the primary crucible for shaping children's personalities and determining the kind of individuals they become as they grow. Children raised by violent parents, for instance, often emulate the behaviors they witness, while those brought up by well-behaved mothers and fathers tend to develop more desirable characters. Secondly, families play a crucial role in ensuring a child's physical well-being. Typically, adolescents receive their dietary nourishment from their families, who understand what foods are beneficial and detrimental to a child's overall development.\n"

Some claim that this approach builds strong relationships among family members, whereas others argue that spending time outside might be more advantageous as it allows them to make more friends and participate in various events, thus making their lives more vibrant. In this essay, I will elaborate on both perspectives in more detail and offer my personal viewpoints.\nTo begin with, many parents emphasize that staying with families can be essential for children, as elders can share their experiences and provide valuable educational advice. For example, it is evident that grandparents who specialize in certain fields can share related knowledge and offer academic guidance to their grandchildren. Moreover, this can lead to the development of close relationships with family members, forming strong bonds and cohesion.\nOn the other hand, spending time outside for recreational activities enhances connections with friends and offers various opportunities. For example, playing sports like football provides an excellent platform for fostering teamwork and leadership skills. Moreover, friendships formed during one's youth can offer valuable support as children transition into adulthood. Another compelling case is that childhood friends can introduce individuals to the career opportunities they have always desired.\nIn conclusion, while some people believe that there are benefits to children staying at home, I personally believe that spending time outside and making friends through various activities is also the best way to nurture their development.

Personally, I believe that both aspects are extremely important, each in its own unique way.\nOn one hand, there are compelling reasons why some employers prioritize candidates with strong social skills. Firstly, in fields like marketing, business, and social media management, soft skills play a pivotal role in persuading customers and generating revenue. Consequently, individuals with extensive academic knowledge but lacking in social skills may find themselves rejected by employers. Additionally, people who possess social skills can collaborate effectively with their colleagues and are more likely to advance to higher positions within the company.\nOn the other hand, I contend that academic qualifications are equally indispensable and cannot be replaced in certain situations. For instance, professions such as doctors require in-depth knowledge because they bear the responsibility for human health and, at times, even the lives of patients. Likewise, educators must ensure that their lectures are accurate and appropriate, making academic qualifications a necessity. Furthermore, without the requisite academic qualifications, employees may struggle to comprehend complex terms that demand a profound understanding. Moreover, not all occupations demand soft skills; consider the roles of scientists or inventors, for instance. They primarily focus on creating innovations and spend most of their time in laboratories, where the key requirement is academic knowledge.\nIn conclusion, I would argue that academic qualifications and social skills hold equal significance in the job market. Both attributes complement each other and are vital in their respective contexts.\n"

In my opinion, I respectfully disagree with the notion that printed media will become obsolete, and I have several compelling reasons to support this viewpoint.\nTo begin with, it is undeniable that the internet has made certain newspapers and books available online at no cost. This convenience has indeed led to a decrease in the purchase of printed materials. However, it's important to note that not all online newspapers and books are freely accessible. Many publications, especially those with specialized content, require users to make payments for access. For instance, newspapers and books focused on academic fields like philosophy, biology, or physics often come with a small fee for readers to access their valuable insights.\nFurthermore, the transition of all print media to online platforms in the future is far from guaranteed. The decision to create an online version depends on the balance between the benefits and costs involved. Publishers will only invest in online versions if it proves advantageous for both readers and their financial well-being. For example, older books containing ancient symbols and historical facts may not generate sufficient interest to justify the expenses of digitization. In such cases, the costs of creating online versions may outweigh the potential benefits, leading to the continued availability of printed copies.\nIn conclusion, for the aforementioned reasons, I maintain the belief that in the future, there will still be a demand for certain types of printed books and newspapers.

Its advanced algorithms and programming ensure the availability of trustworthy data across various fields. This empowers individuals to expand their knowledge and gain deeper insights into diverse subjects. Additionally, the internet offers various entertainment options, such as social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube, enabling people to unwind and alleviate stress after long hours of work or study.\nHowever, when evaluating pivotal inventions in human history, electricity undoubtedly takes precedence over the internet.

In my view, I have reservations about this phenomenon.\nFirst and foremost, it is undeniable that the Internet offers students access to a wealth of information. However, in today's digital age, a multitude of fraudulent and misleading content exists online, primarily for personal gain. To illustrate, certain online learning materials are aggressively promoted, luring in many eager learners. Nevertheless, these materials sometimes prove to be nothing more than a ploy to make a profit. Consequently, students may end up investing in materials that are of little or no value. Furthermore, online information is not always reliable, which can have a detrimental impact on students' knowledge. Additionally, when children navigate the Internet without parental supervision, they may encounter websites that are not suitable for their age, potentially exposing them to harmful content. For instance, violent films or video clips depicting inappropriate behavior could influence students to imitate such actions, leading to harm to themselves and others. In today's fast-paced world, many parents find themselves overwhelmed with work and are unable to provide constant supervision and guidance. Therefore, studying at home through the Internet can pose risks to the well-being of students.\nAnother important aspect to consider is the essential role that traditional schools play in a student's educational journey. The hierarchical structure of the education system, with various grade levels, ensures that students acquire knowledge progressively and appropriately. For instance, students in the early grades focus on fundamental skills like learning the alphabet and pronunciation, while as they progress to higher grades, they tackle more challenging subjects. This structured approach enables students to acquire knowledge in a systematic and effective manner. Moreover, the learning materials provided by schools are carefully curated to suit the needs of students at different stages of their education. Last but certainly not least, teachers in traditional schools impart not only academic knowledge but also important life skills and values. They instill qualities like politeness, empathy, and compassion in students. The holistic education provided by schools encompasses a wide range of valuable lessons. For these reasons, it is evident that traditional schools continue to be the optimal choice for a child's overall development.\nIn conclusion, while the Internet does offer a plethora of valuable information, it is important to acknowledge its shortcomings, including the prevalence of misinformation and the potential for exposure to harmful content. Traditional schools, with their structured educational system and comprehensive curriculum, remain an indispensable part of a student's learning journey.

Some advocate for the effectiveness of implementing car-free days, while others contend that alternative methods could yield better results. This essay will delve into both sides of the argument before presenting my own viewpoint.\nOn one hand, proponents of car-free days assert that these designated periods, during which cars are not allowed on the roads, can significantly reduce air pollution. It is undeniable that car emissions are a major contributor to environmental pollution due to their high concentration of pollutants like CO2. By designating certain days without vehicular traffic, toxic gases are not released into the atmosphere, leading to an enhancement in air quality. Consequently, the car-free days policy is regarded as a commendable approach to eradicating harmful emissions from our environment.\nOn the other hand, the endeavor to diminish air pollution encompasses a broader spectrum of strategies beyond just car-free days. For instance, the adoption of electric cars is a noteworthy method to combat air pollution. Electric vehicles operate on electric motors rather than fossil fuels, producing no pollutants during operation. Evidence from developed nations with a substantial electric vehicle presence illustrates a marked improvement in air quality. Another efficacious approach involves promoting the use of public transportation, such as subways. While public transport may still emit CO2, it contributes to a reduction in overall pollutant levels and poses less harm to the environment.

From my perspective, a generous compensation package holds significant importance for job seekers.\nOn one hand, it is easy to comprehend why some individuals argue that money is paramount for people's survival. Firstly, having a substantial income or a well-paying job ensures the fulfillment of basic living necessities such as housing, food, transportation, and various amenities. With a steady income, workers can effectively manage their finances, covering expenses like electricity and water bills without difficulty. I firmly believe that it is highly advantageous for employees to maintain their own financial stability and receive a fair wage. Additionally, individuals use their earnings to maintain their physical and mental well-being. For instance, opting for healthier organic food can enhance one's physical health by providing essential nutrients like collagen and vitamins. Consequently, they are more likely to stay in good shape, perform their job duties in a healthy manner, and achieve a positive work-life balance.\nOn the flip side, although income is undeniably vital, I still maintain that there are several other crucial factors to consider when applying for a job.

While studying foreign languages undeniably offers significant benefits for work and travel, I firmly believe that there are indeed more profound motivations why individuals opt to acquire a new language.\nLearning a foreign language can be undeniably advantageous for work and travel, as it enhances one's grasp of words and terminology and aids in avoiding misunderstandings. Firstly, if employees are proficient in the language, they can comprehend legal documents like contracts more accurately, thus reducing the risk of misconceptions. This, in turn, promotes the smooth operation of a company without the need to hire a native-speaking translator. Additionally, effective communication with colleagues who share the same language fosters connections, which can prove invaluable in a professional context. Furthermore, tourists relying on online translations or dictionaries during their travels are more likely to encounter misunderstandings. Acquiring proficiency in the local language mitigates these communication challenges, ensuring a more enjoyable travel experience and smoother interactions with the local population.\nHowever, I am of the opinion that people learn new languages not only for practical reasons but also to expand their knowledge and exercise their cognitive abilities. Acquiring a language necessitates delving into the culture and various facets of the native population. Language learners have the opportunity to explore esteemed attributes such as traditions and modern technological advancements, thus broadening their understanding of the world. Another compelling rationale for learning new languages is the cognitive benefits it offers, promoting a healthier brain.

It is a fact that students are typically permitted to enter their school premises only when they are dressed in the prescribed uniform. This practice makes it easier for security personnel to identify potential intruders who may have malicious intentions, such as theft or even acts of violence, thereby safeguarding valuable school property and the lives of innocent students. Additionally, wearing a school uniform helps create a level playing field for all students. This is because it fosters a sense of equality among them, regardless of their financial background or racial identity. Consequently, it reduces feelings of inferiority and strengthens the bonds of friendship among students.\nOn the contrary, opponents argue that school uniforms may limit students' creative expression. Many students feel that they are deprived of the freedom to express themselves through their clothing choices and are restricted in their ability to explore different styles. Furthermore, wearing a uniform can be a source of discomfort during physical activities, such as sports or dancing. The tightness and rigidity of uniforms can make it challenging for students to fully engage in these activities, which can lead to frustration.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that school uniforms are the best choice for ensuring the safety of students and protecting the school's valuable assets, while also fostering a fair and inclusive learning environment.

Finding friends is a universal pursuit, and in today's digital age, online platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have become popular avenues for forming connections. However, there is an ongoing debate about whether friendships that develop online can be as meaningful as those established through face-to-face interactions. In my view, I partially agree with this perspective, and I will outline my reasons in the following paragraphs.\nOne significant advantage of online friendships is their ability to transcend geographical boundaries. The internet, often referred to as the World Wide Web, allows people from different parts of the world to connect with one another. This not only fosters global relationships but can also facilitate international business collaborations, benefiting both parties through favorable exchange rates and reduced labor costs. Another advantage lies in the anonymity that online interactions provide. Many individuals, particularly introverts, feel more at ease sharing their thoughts and life experiences when they can do so from the comfort of their own surroundings. Moreover, the diverse backgrounds and cultures that converge online can foster friendships among groups that may not feel comfortable engaging in such interactions face-to-face. A notable example is the connection between citizens of Pakistan and India, who, despite differences in culture, religion, and traditions, often find common ground and understanding through social media.\nHowever, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of online friendships. One notable drawback is the absence of emotional cues that are inherent in face-to-face communication. Facial expressions, changes in voice tone, and hand gestures cannot be conveyed through online messages, leading to potential misunderstandings and conflicts. Another concern is the prevalence of exaggeration, insincerity, and lack of commitment in some online interactions. Many people present themselves differently online than they do in real life, which can lead to disappointment and problems when online friends eventually meet face-to-face. Lastly, the longevity of online relationships can be uncertain, as internet acquaintances may disappear when needed the most.\nIn conclusion, both online and face-to-face friendships have their advantages and drawbacks. Ultimately, the quality of a friendship matters more than the mode of its formation. Online friendships can offer valuable global connections and a sense of anonymity that fosters open communication, but they may lack the depth and emotional richness of in-person relationships. It is essential to recognize the unique strengths and weaknesses of each approach and prioritize the quality of the connections we form, regardless of how they originate.\n"

Some members of society argue that these devices should be prohibited in certain areas, similar to how smoking has been banned. From my perspective, I am totally against this notion for several reasons. In the following paragraphs, I will explain my position and provide examples and clarifications.\nTo begin with, there are numerous reasons behind the importance of allowing the public to carry their smartphones anywhere. The primary reason is the multitasking capabilities that these phones provide through the power of the internet. For instance, smartphones can perform a wide range of tasks beyond their primary function of communication, such as socializing, reading books, listening to music, conducting meetings, attending lectures, and keeping up with current events. These features help keep the community informed about recent developments in all areas. Furthermore, some people can pursue their careers with these devices. For example, language learning classes are no longer limited to physical education institutions; there are many mobile applications like \"Kampily\" where teachers can communicate with students to teach them the language they need, anytime and anywhere.\nThe second main reason is that using a smartphone cannot harm the community in the same way that smoking does. Comparing smoking to using a mobile phone is unjust. It is not fair to equate smoking habits with using a mobile phone, just as it is unfair to compare fire to water. As is well-known, smoking not only harms the person who smokes but also affects anyone who breathes in the polluted air. In contrast, being engrossed in a mobile phone cannot have an adverse effect on anyone else but the phone user.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that banning the use of smartphones like smoking is not justified, primarily due to two significant reasons: the limited negative impact of mobile phone use on other people and the countless benefits offered by mobile features.\n"

      "paragraph": "Many people hold the view that teenagers should engage in unpaid community service in their leisure time, arguing that it would be beneficial for both young individuals and society as a whole. Personally, I partially agree with this viewpoint.\nOn one hand, participating in community service without receiving payment can provide valuable experiences for teenagers during their free time. This is primarily because some individuals focus on improving their skills and personal development without expecting any financial rewards. For example, a group of young people volunteering at a nursing home can gain insights into potential career paths while forming meaningful connections with the elderly residents. Furthermore, volunteer work, even though it's unpaid, holds intrinsic value for the community. This is particularly relevant in areas with high poverty and unemployment rates, where young participants can earn certificates that will be beneficial for their future job opportunities.\nOn the other hand, it's important to recognize that teenagers also need to earn money to support themselves. This is especially true for those who wish to contribute to their family's financial well-being. For instance, some youngsters use their earnings to buy personal items like laptops and clothing, reducing their dependence on parental support. This financial independence can empower young individuals and foster self-reliance. Additionally, providing monetary compensation for teenagers' efforts can serve as a long-term motivator because it acts as a tangible reward, boosting their morale.\nIn conclusion, there is a prevailing belief that teenagers should participate in unpaid community work, benefiting both the individuals and society. However, I believe that a more balanced perspective, considering both unpaid and paid opportunities, would be more appropriate in this context.\n"

      "paragraph": "The recent surge in health deterioration has become a public problem, prompting many individuals to consider potential solutions. The debate revolves around whether increasing the number of sports facilities is the most effective approach or if other methods hold greater promise. From my perspective, while constructing sports amenities is indeed a valuable step, I believe that proper health education would yield more significant outcomes.\nClearly, the proliferation of sports facilities makes them easily accessible to individuals, given the increasing numbers. Consequently, people can conveniently encounter multiple sports venues while they are out and about. This can serve as a reminder to prioritize their physical well-being. Moreover, the proximity of sports amenities to residential areas can enhance people's willingness to engage in physical activities. For example, by placing sports facilities in public areas near residential zones, individuals are more likely to participate in exercise. As a result, providing more sports facilities for the public can contribute to improving their overall health.\nHowever, I would argue that increasing the availability of sports amenities may have limited impact on public health. Despite the growing number of sports facilities, many individuals still struggle to prioritize their health due to laziness and a lack of interest in sports. Therefore, I firmly believe that education plays a pivotal role in addressing this issue comprehensively. For instance, the government should implement a strategy to raise awareness about the consequences of physical inactivity and the associated benefits of regular exercise. This educational approach can highlight that physical inactivity is a leading cause of health problems, such as backaches, headaches, obesity, and even diminished creativity and concentration at work. By understanding these consequences, people may be more motivated to incorporate regular physical activity into their lives.\nIn conclusion, while the expansion of sports facilities can contribute to improving public health, I believe that education is a more effective and sustainable solution.\n"

In my opinion, this trend has both positive and negative consequences.\nOn the positive side, the widespread popularity of advertisements can have negative effects on individuals and the economy as a whole. One negative effect is that it encourages impulse buying, making it difficult for consumers to save money. Many companies strive to capture and maintain customers' attention through extensive advertising, often offering substantial promotions for new products upon their release. For instance, Apple's persuasive marketing tactics attract young consumers to the latest phone models, even when their existing phones still function well. Additionally, organizations must allocate substantial budgets for advertising campaigns, which in turn raises the cost of products and services. Consequently, consumers end up paying more for the items they purchase.\nOn the other hand, the extensive reach of advertising can also yield some positive outcomes that deserve consideration. Firstly, it enhances consumers' knowledge about the products and services advertised, making them feel more informed when making purchasing decisions. For example, young individuals gain valuable insights into the use of digital devices by watching commercial television, enabling them to make better use of these products. Secondly, advertising contributes significantly to a nation's revenue. From an economic perspective, advertising plays a pivotal role in stimulating overall economic growth. The commercial industry, which is worth billions of dollars, attracts substantial investments from manufacturers aiming to strengthen brand recognition. This, in turn, leads to increased sales and contributes to tax revenues for the nation.\nIn conclusion, the increasing popularity of advertising has both positive and negative impacts on individuals and the broader economy.\n"

I respectfully disagree with this viewpoint and will elaborate on my stance in this essay.\nTo begin with, it is essential to recognize that fast food does not pose the same level of harm to human health as the drug, alcohol, and tobacco industries do. While the consumption of fast food can contribute to obesity, the abuse of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco not only leads to addiction but also fuels various societal issues, including crime, violence, and addiction.\nFurthermore, it is important to acknowledge the convenience factor associated with fast food. Fast food serves as a practical solution for individuals who have limited time to prepare their meals, especially in today's fast-paced world where time is often scarce. In such circumstances, options like dining at fast food restaurants or utilizing online ordering services have gained popularity, providing quick and effortless meal solutions. For instance, my younger brother and I frequently visit Jollibee when our parents are occupied and unable to prepare meals for our family. This choice not only proves to be cost-effective but also offers the convenience of having food delivered to our doorstep without any additional delivery charges.\nIn conclusion, considering the points mentioned above, I firmly believe that the government should apply less stringent regulations to the fast food industry when compared to the drug, alcohol, and tobacco sectors.\n"

While some individuals argue that the utilization of robots can bring numerous advantages, others are concerned about the potential threats it might pose to society in the long term. In this essay, I will explore the reasoning behind both perspectives before explaining why I lean towards the former viewpoint.\nOn one hand, there are several reasons why some people believe that robots could have adverse effects on human beings. Firstly, as robotics technology advances significantly, there is a concern that unemployment rates will rise. To be more specific, robots can replace humans in performing repetitive and physically demanding tasks such as driving, factory work, or construction work, often with greater precision and efficiency. Consequently, individuals in these professions may struggle to earn a sufficient income to sustain their livelihoods, leading to a decline in their living standards. For example, the emergence of self-driving cars is expected to eliminate the need for human drivers.\nOn the other hand, proponents of robotics technology highlight its numerous benefits. One significant advantage is the potential for robots to boost productivity and efficiency across various industries, thereby contributing to economic growth. Robots excel at tasks that are dangerous or physically strenuous for humans, reducing the risk of workplace accidents and injuries. Moreover, robots can play a vital role in different sectors, including healthcare. For instance, they can assist individuals with mobility impairments in performing their daily activities, enhancing their independence and overall quality of life. Furthermore, advancements in robotics technology, such as nanotechnology, offer the possibility of robots navigating within the human body without the need for complex surgeries, creating new opportunities for medical interventions.\nIn conclusion, the widespread adoption of robotics technology has generated diverse opinions regarding its impact on human society. While concerns about unemployment are valid, the advantages of increased productivity, efficiency, and innovations across various fields outweigh these concerns. By embracing robotics technology and addressing the associated challenges, we can harness its potential to create a more prosperous and technologically advanced society.\n"

While there are some similarities between these activities, I do not find it convincing to impose a ban on mobile phone use.\nOn one hand, there are valid reasons to consider banning mobile phones in specific places. Firstly, many users become excessively engrossed in their phone screens for extended periods, making these devices as addictive as cigarettes. Minors, in particular, are susceptible to phone addiction due to the distracting visual elements on electronic displays, which hinder their concentration and strain their eyesight. Both smoking and phone usage also entail health risks. Smokers expose themselves and those nearby to various respiratory illnesses, while mobile phone users frequently encounter electromagnetic radiation from their devices. Therefore, prohibiting phones, at least in public spaces, might appear to be a helpful measure to prevent several potential dangers.\nOn the other hand, it is not always appropriate to restrict people from using their cell phones. Firstly, mobile phones serve practical purposes, unlike cigarettes, which are strictly consumable. Individuals such as entrepreneurs and managers rely on their phones for work, so banning them from doing so would be unreasonable. Additionally, claims regarding the health risks associated with mobile phones are uncertain and lack solid evidence. There have been no recorded outbreaks of health problems caused by cellular devices since their invention. Furthermore, many studies investigating the potential health implications of mobile phone usage have failed to produce conclusive findings. Taking these factors into account, there is little justification for prohibiting cell phones.\nIn my view, although both smoking and using a mobile phone can cause discomfort to those nearby, it is not warranted to ban the latter.

From my perspective, I believe that engaging in community service offers more advantages than disadvantages for students.\nLife skills are essential in one's personal development, and through voluntary activities, high school students can enhance their communication and teamwork skills, as well as learn to manage their time efficiently and improve their organizational abilities. Unfortunately, due to the pervasive influence of the Internet, smart devices, and changing lifestyles, many students tend to spend a significant portion of their free time indoors, engaging in solitary activities. Regrettably, this can lead to increased introversion and a decline in their life skills.\nFurthermore, achieving a healthy balance in today's world, where academic qualifications often take precedence, is a significant challenge. Many students overlook the importance of their physical and mental well-being. Engaging in voluntary activities can help address this issue by promoting both physical and mental health. It also offers students a chance to explore different worldviews and preferences, preventing them from becoming overwhelmed by their studies. In addition to its positive impact on mental health, participating in unpaid community service can contribute to physical well-being by aiding in muscle development and enhancing cardiovascular function. Ultimately, a fundamental goal is to instill moral values during adolescence.\nIn conclusion, I strongly support the idea of making unpaid community service a mandatory part of high school programs, and I hope this initiative will be implemented in high schools in the near future.\n"

Some members of society argue that these devices should be prohibited in certain areas and places, similar to the way smoking has been banned. From my perspective, I am totally against this notion for several reasons. In the following paragraphs, I will explain my position and provide examples and clarifications.\nTo begin with, there are many reasons behind the importance of allowing the public to carry their smartphones anywhere. The main reason is the multitude of tasks that these phones can perform with the power of the internet. To clarify, smartphones can handle a wide range of tasks beyond their primary function of communication, such as socializing, reading books, listening to music, conducting meetings, attending lectures, staying updated with news, and more. These features help keep the community informed about recent events in all aspects of life. Furthermore, some people can pursue their careers with these devices. For example, language learning classes are no longer confined to physical education institutions; there are now many phone applications like \"Kampily\" where teachers can interact with students to teach them the language they need anytime and anywhere.\nThe second main reason is that using a smartphone cannot harm the community in the same way smoking does. If we were to compare smoking with using a mobile phone, it would not be a just comparison. It's not fair to equate smoking habits with using a mobile phone, just as it's not fair to compare fire with water. As is well-known, the consumption of cigarettes not only harms the person who smokes but also affects anyone who breathes the polluted air, whereas using a mobile phone can have no effect on anyone else except the phone user.\nTo sum up, I firmly believe that the usage of smartphones should not be banned like smoking due to two significant reasons: the limited negative impact of mobile phone use on other people and the countless benefits offered by mobile features.\n"

In my opinion, children's wrongdoings are influenced by their behavior and various factors, and they should face consequences for their actions. On one hand, parents serve as role models for their children. A clear example is in Vietnam, where approximately 50% of children who engage in acts of school violence come from homes marked by domestic violence perpetrated by their fathers or mothers. Furthermore, children often lack the knowledge and experience to distinguish whether their actions violate the law or not, and their awareness depends largely on the guidance they receive from their parents. In past cases, parents have even incited their offspring to undermine the trust of others to gain illicit financial benefits. These children were initially trained to steal items of little value and later collaborated with their parents in more serious fraudulent activities.\nHowever, despite the arguments mentioned above, I believe that children who break the rules should be held directly accountable for their actions. One reason for this is that penalties for minors primarily aim to nurture their character. It is evident that children take responsibility for their violations by undergoing non-custodial reform programs lasting less than three years. Statistics show that 80% of these children exhibit positive behaviors and reintegrate into civilized society after completing their reformatory terms. Another reason is that the toxic information found on social media platforms can be a hidden source of risk, distorting the ideology of children. In recent years, some crimes committed by children have been attributed to their following the instructions of content creators on YouTube. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that other parties should share responsibility for children's wrongful actions.\nIn conclusion, while parents play a crucial role in educating their children, the children themselves should take responsibility for their actions and learn to discern valuable information from harmful content.\n"

However, I believe that this trend has more negative consequences, especially for young individuals.\nThere are several understandable reasons behind people's preference for home ownership over renting. Firstly, some individuals are materialistic, equating home ownership with their economic status. To them, owning a house symbolizes financial success, while renting is seen as a sign of limited means. Consequently, owning a house bolsters their sense of respectability.\nFurthermore, owning a house provides stability in terms of accommodation. Renters often face uncertainties as landlords may terminate rental agreements or increase rent substantially. This instability can lead to financial stress and the hassle of finding a new place to live. Additionally, real estate is often considered a long-term investment. Owning a house can prove to be a wise and profitable venture, generating significant income over time.\nHowever, despite these reasons, I believe that this trend has more negative implications, especially for young people who may not have substantial assets. For instance, in Vietnam, purchasing a house typically requires a substantial payment, often exceeding one billion dong, while the average monthly income is merely 10 million dong. This substantial financial burden may necessitate additional financing, such as a bank loan, which can extend for ten to twenty years. Such prolonged debt repayment can disrupt the balance between work and personal life, as individuals often work tirelessly to meet their financial obligations, neglecting other aspects of their lives.\nMoreover, owning a house comes with additional expenses, including taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. These costs do not apply to renters, allowing them to redirect the saved funds toward other investments to increase their income.\nIn conclusion, while there are valid reasons for desiring home ownership, I strongly believe that it has a predominantly negative impact, especially on young people with limited financial resources.\n"

In this essay, we will explore the reasons behind this trend and suggest some measures to address it.\nOne of the primary factors contributing to the high rate of recidivism is the difficulties ex-convicts face when reintegrating into society. Many members of the public hold negative attitudes towards former inmates and may treat them with hostility, making it challenging for them to readjust. This social stigma can lead to feelings of resentment and alienation, pushing released prisoners towards criminal activities. Furthermore, ex-convicts often struggle to find employment due to their criminal records, leaving them with limited options to sustain themselves financially. This financial strain can drive some to resort to activities like theft or pickpocketing.\nAdditionally, research has revealed a connection between mental illness and recidivism. Many former offenders do not receive adequate mental health treatment upon their release, increasing their susceptibility to impulsive behaviors, such as drug abuse.\nTo address these issues, several preventive measures can be implemented. Firstly, the government can play a crucial role by fostering social integration between former inmates and the wider community through various campaigns and strategies. Creating job opportunities for ex-convicts is essential, as it allows them to rebuild their lives and become financially self-sufficient. Beyond material support, providing mental health assistance is also vital in addressing this problem. Changing the negative perceptions of rehabilitated inmates and recognizing that most first-time offenders deserve a second chance can help reduce their sense of social isolation, a key factor in recidivism.\nIn conclusion, the challenges of reintegration and the lack of mental health support contribute to the high rate of reoffending among ex-convicts. To mitigate this issue, practical actions, including creating favorable conditions for their return to society, should be considered and implemented.\n"

However, others argue against this idea, asserting that both men and women should have access to all types of work to promote gender balance. While both perspectives have their merits, I personally agree with the former view.\nThe rationale behind those advocating for a balance of work between men and women is that each specific job requires a combination of abilities and skills that can be found in both genders. It is evident that a well-rounded workforce comprising both men and women contributes to efficient work environments. Most companies do not have regulations dictating that only one gender can apply for a job. To be more precise, many companies require a mix of intelligence and diligence from both men and women to ensure optimal outcomes in their work. Consequently, promoting gender balance in the workplace should be a priority for authorities. This approach allows men and women to engage in different types of work, fostering their personal growth and knowledge acquisition.\nConversely, others contend that males and females should be assigned work roles based on their inherent abilities. Clearly, both men and women possess natural capabilities that make them better suited for specific types of work. For instance, women often excel in teaching, nurturing, and caring for young children, such as toddlers. On the other hand, men are often better equipped for physically demanding jobs in harsh environments, such as outdoor labor or remote-area work. To achieve the best results, it is essential that men and women are assigned work that aligns with their respective expertise. In addition, authorities should provide a wider range of job opportunities to enable laborers to choose roles that best match their abilities.\nIn conclusion, while there is ongoing debate regarding whether individuals should be equally proficient in all types of jobs or should specialize in roles that align with their natural abilities, I believe that people should be assigned jobs that suit their inherent capabilities to enable them to excel to the fullest extent.\n"

From my perspective, although sports are often regarded as a leisure activity, they serve significant social and psychological functions.\nThe notion that sports primarily serve as a leisure pastime is supported by readily apparent facts. Most individuals engage in sports either as spectators or participants to relieve stress and do not view them as seriously as other aspects of life. For instance, in England, football holds the status of a national sport, and many people partake in amateur matches, follow their local teams, and engage in conversations about sports with friends and family. Each of these activities can be broadly categorized as a means of relaxation, offering a purposefully unproductive and enjoyable use of one's free time. If surveyed, the majority of individuals would likely affirm that sports are an important yet entirely recreational part of their lives.\nNevertheless, sports indeed play a crucial role in fulfilling several deep psychological needs. The average sports enthusiast invests a significant amount of time and emotional attachment in the success or failure of their favorite team.

Personally, I strongly disagree with this perspective.\nTo commence, the allure of participating in extreme sports, such as skydiving and skiing, lies in the fact that they are not as hazardous as some people presume. This can be elucidated by the requirement for individuals interested in these activities to undergo training and familiarize themselves with the established safety protocols. A notable example can be found in skiing, where adherence to safety guidelines is frequently stressed to minimize the likelihood of accidents. Furthermore, the availability of various sports equipment designed to enhance safety further supports the argument that these extreme sports can be pursued with appropriate precautionary measures in place.\nFurthermore, the notion of banning extreme sports is impractical and unjust. While it is acknowledged that these activities entail inherent risks, a blanket ban on their practice is unfeasible. This is primarily because such pursuits hold great appeal for adolescents, and people should have the autonomy to determine how they spend their leisure time. This is aptly demonstrated in the case of activities like base jumping, which attract a considerable number of enthusiasts and are typically conducted in remote, non-residential areas. Consequently, considering the specific settings in which extreme sports are typically pursued, banning them would be unwarranted.\nIn conclusion, for the aforementioned reasons, I firmly assert that skydiving, skiing, and other extreme sports should continue to be permissible. It is advisable for both the government and individuals to take proactive steps in establishing safe facilities conducive to the practice of these sports.\n"

Consequently, there is an ongoing debate about whether educators should refrain from utilizing computers in the classroom and revert to teaching fundamental study skills. In this essay, I strongly oppose this notion because technology can enhance educational effectiveness and enable students to engage in distance learning.\nComputers should be viewed as valuable tools that support students in their academic pursuits. Indeed, laptops possess the capacity to store study materials, thereby creating favorable conditions for students to revisit lectures when necessary. This can lead to a deeper comprehension of complex subjects, ultimately improving their academic performance. For instance, in my school, some students who initially struggled with grasping academic concepts experienced significant success after incorporating Notepad, a functional program for note-taking and knowledge consolidation, into their study routine. In just one month of using this tool, their grades improved considerably.\nAnother compelling reason to embrace computers is their role in facilitating distance learning for students. Undoubtedly, there are numerous online teaching platforms available on computers, enabling individuals to study from anywhere they choose. This flexibility helps students overcome geographical barriers and participate in classes even when facing unexpected challenges. A prime example of this is Zoom, an application that educators heavily relied on during the COVID-19 pandemic to deliver lessons to students confined to their homes. This ensured that students remained fully engaged with their academic studies before returning to school. To neglect the potential of these technologies would be a missed opportunity for education.\nIn conclusion, considering the advantages of computers in enhancing learning and making education accessible irrespective of geographical constraints, educators should integrate computing devices into their teaching methods rather than dismissing them.\n"

In this essay, we will explore both perspectives before presenting my own stance, which aligns with the latter viewpoint.\nSupporters of early education assert that it can discourage excessive screen time and encourage valuable learning habits, such as memorizing poetry and solving math problems. This, they argue, can equip children with substantial knowledge even before they enter primary school. However, this perspective overlooks children's natural abilities, rendering the idea somewhat futile. Even if children start learning earlier, they may struggle to absorb all the information and may not be able to apply this knowledge effectively in the future.\nThis argument gains further strength when we consider the advantages of commencing education when children begin primary school. Starting their formal education at around seven years old allows them to independently explore their surroundings, fostering creativity. Moreover, it enables children to prioritize their physical health, something that formal education cannot replicate. Engaging in sports activities has a profound impact, boosting enthusiasm and teamwork skills. These experiences contribute to a productive day and greater motivation for learning.\nIn conclusion, while there are valid arguments in favor of initiating a child's education at an early age, I contend that commencing formal education at around seven years old offers significant advantages.\n"

In my perspective, I strongly agree with this notion because, by embracing social responsibilities, businesses can attract a larger pool of employees and improve their public perception.\nFirst and foremost, embracing social responsibilities can enable companies to attract high-quality employees. Specifically, accomplished professionals are more inclined to work for organizations with a positive reputation for social responsibility. The way a company treats society often reflects how it treats its employees. In essence, only by taking social responsibilities seriously can businesses establish trust among their workforce, ensuring that dedication and efforts are valued. This, in turn, allows them to attract more skilled workers. For example, Vingroup, a Vietnamese corporation, allocates substantial financial resources for community charity work, which appeals to a diverse range of potential employees. According to a survey, one of the primary reasons for choosing to work for Vingroup is its reputation for caring about society.\nAnother reason why I support the idea of businesses shouldering their societal responsibilities is that it can enhance their image in the eyes of consumers. Specifically, when companies collaborate with local authorities and residents to protect the environment or fulfill civic duties, they may earn recognition within the community and potentially gain stronger support from local people in their business endeavors. For instance, the American retail giant Target Corp is well-known for its various social responsibility programs, including financial contributions to local communities in the form of education grants.

Nevertheless, it seems that many individuals prefer alternative modes of travel such as motorcycles or private cars over bicycles. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons for this preference and suggest potential solutions to enhance the popularity of cycling.\nFrom my perspective, there are several reasons for the limited popularity of cycling among the general public. Firstly, it is undeniable that bicycles are the most suitable means of transportation for individuals traveling alone. However, in large cities like New York or Beijing, residents often commute significant distances to work or school on a daily basis. Consequently, they tend to opt for modes of transportation that save time and energy.\nAnother significant factor contributing to the unpopularity of cycling is the lack of dedicated cycling lanes. For example, many cities do not have designated areas exclusively reserved for cyclists, resulting in numerous accidents and property damage due to the absence of proper cycling infrastructure. In summary, these reasons explain why bicycles are not widely embraced in various parts of the world.\nIn my view, this situation can be addressed by implementing changes in the transportation system. The first solution is for authorities to establish dedicated cycling lanes, which would reduce traffic-related fatalities and enable cyclists to ride safely. Additionally, raising public awareness about the health and environmental benefits of cycling is essential. Local governments and officials should also consider imposing heavier fines on private car owners to incentivize people to choose bicycles. These measures will not only reduce the use of other motorized forms of transportation but also promote the popularity of cycling.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that the current lack of appeal for bicycles can be attributed to various factors, including inadequate infrastructure and regulations. Therefore, it is imperative to implement effective solutions that will not only boost the popularity of cycling but also reduce carbon emissions significantly.\n"

Some individuals assert that the most pressing issue is the loss of specific plant and animal species, while others argue that there are more crucial environmental concerns to address. In my view, while the loss of particular species is indeed a significant environmental issue, there are other problems that warrant greater priority.\nOn one hand, proponents of the belief that the loss of specific species constitutes the primary environmental problem argue that it has severe consequences for ecosystems and biodiversity. Each species plays a unique role in maintaining the balance of an ecosystem, and the loss of one species can have a cascading effect on others. An example of this is the California red-legged frog, which is now a federally protected endangered species due to overhunting for food, resulting in a significant reduction in its numbers. Furthermore, the loss of species can have detrimental impacts on human societies as it can disrupt essential ecosystem services like clean water, air purification, and climate regulation.\nOn the other hand, detractors argue that there are more critical environmental problems that require immediate attention. They contend that issues such as climate change, deforestation, and pollution have broader and more immediate consequences for the planet and human well-being. Climate change, in particular, poses significant threats to ecosystems, as rising temperatures and altered weather patterns can lead to habitat loss, species migration, and increased extinction rates. Additionally, pollution, including air and water pollution, adversely affects both human health and the environment, causing widespread damage to ecosystems and biodiversity. An example illustrating this point occurred during the Coronavirus outbreak in 2020 when numerous factories worldwide were closed for quarantine, significantly reducing pollution and resulting in an improved environment in the oceans and forests.\nIn conclusion, while some argue that the loss of specific species is the primary environmental problem of our time, I believe that there are more pressing issues that demand immediate attention.

      "question": "The benefits and drawbacks of expanding low-cost airlines",
      "paragraph": "The debate surrounding the expansion of low-cost airlines, enabling people to travel worldwide, has been quite intense. While many argue that this development has negative aspects, others, myself included, believe that increasing low-cost airlines can be beneficial.\nCertainly, there are reasons why one might view this as a negative trend. When people travel the world at lower prices, it becomes challenging to ensure their safety during their journeys. Furthermore, this could result in various serious consequences. For instance, there have been numerous instances of fatalities during air travel due to the use of low-quality and unsafe airlines. Additionally, passengers may not enjoy a comfortable travel experience. These factors lead me to disagree with the idea of expanding low-cost airlines.\nHowever, despite these concerns, I am inclined to support the proponents who see it as a positive development. The primary reason is that traveling the world provides people with the opportunity to explore diverse cultures and enrich their knowledge in various fields. Moreover, it enables them to meet new friends from different countries, learn about numerous cultures, and build valuable relationships. Additionally, it allows individuals to rejuvenate themselves after long hours of hard work, ultimately enhancing their productivity upon their return.\nIn conclusion, while there are valid arguments against the expansion of low-cost airlines, I personally believe that it is the best recommendation for all of us. The potential benefits, such as cultural enrichment and personal growth, outweigh the drawbacks, and with appropriate safety measures, this can indeed be a positive development for travelers worldwide.\n"

      "question": "The pros and cons of taking a gap year between high school and university",
      "paragraph": "Some individuals argue that young adults should consider taking a year off for either work or travel after completing high school before embarking on their university studies. This notion has its merits, such as gaining valuable work experience and enhancing communication skills. However, it also comes with some drawbacks, including potential gaps in academic knowledge and reduced employment opportunities.\nOn the positive side, opting for a gap year for work or travel can offer several advantages. Firstly, it allows young individuals to build their work experience. During this time, they can engage in various job roles, acquiring practical skills that not only enrich their real-life experience but also help shape their future career paths. Secondly, engaging in work or travel experiences often improves communication skills. Stepping out of their comfort zones exposes them to diverse people and situations, fostering improved interpersonal abilities.\nConversely, there are notable drawbacks to this idea. One of the primary concerns is the risk of losing academic knowledge during the gap year. As they take time off from formal education, the information they acquired in high school may start to fade, potentially causing them to lag behind their peers and society in general once they enter university. Additionally, there is the possibility that students who opt for a gap year may struggle to secure employment. This is because their additional year away from academic studies may not significantly enhance their qualifications, potentially resulting in less impressive CVs and reduced job prospects.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that the concept of taking a gap year between high school and university studies has both advantages and disadvantages. The decision to pursue this path should be made carefully, taking into account the individual's circumstances and goals.\n"
