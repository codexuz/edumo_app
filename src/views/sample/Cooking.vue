## Cooking


**Do you like cooking?**

I think I can say that I am a good cook, so yes, I like the process. It just works as a meditation for me, like when I am cutting the veggies and I can have some time to rethink some of the things which I canâ€™t consider any other time. Also, it is super fun and creative process, which makes me happy about it.

**How often do you cook?**

Everyday! I cook for my main meals myself and try to come up with different options for snacks in between them. I believe it helps to keep my creativity on a high level.

**What dishes are you best at cooking?**

I am flawless at spaghetti Bolognese, which is my favorite meal both to cook and to eat. My friends from Portugal once made this dish for me and ever since that, I am in love with this dish.
